# CONCURRENCY

Certainly! Let's explore each aspect of concurrency in Go:

## SHARE BY COMMUNICATING

In Go, the mantra for concurrency is "Don't communicate by sharing memory; share memory by communicating." This principle encourages developers to use channels to pass data between goroutines instead of using shared memory for communication.

## GOROUTINES

Goroutines are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime. They allow concurrent execution of functions or methods within a Go program. Goroutines are created using the `go` keyword followed by a function call.

```go
func main() {
  go doTask1()
  go doTask2()
  // ...
}

func doTask1() {
  // Task 1 implementation
}

func doTask2() {
  // Task 2 implementation
}
```

In this example, `doTask1` and `doTask2` are executed concurrently as goroutines.

## CHANNELS

Channels are the pipes that connect concurrent goroutines. They allow communication and synchronization between goroutines by passing data from one goroutine to another. Channels can be unbuffered (synchronous) or buffered (asynchronous).

```go
ch := make(chan int) // Unbuffered channel
ch := make(chan int, 10) // Buffered channel with capacity 10
```

## CHANNELS OF CHANNELS

In Go, you can create channels of channels to build more complex communication patterns. This allows for fine-grained control over how data is passed between goroutines.

```go
ch := make(chan chan int)
```

## PARALLELIZATION

Parallelization refers to the concurrent execution of tasks on multiple CPUs or CPU cores to improve performance and efficiency. In Go, parallelization can be achieved by running goroutines concurrently and utilizing all available CPU cores.

```go
package main

import "runtime"

func main() {
  runtime.GOMAXPROCS(runtime.NumCPU()) // Utilize all available CPU cores
  // ...
}
```

## A LEAKY BUFFER

A leaky buffer is a buffered channel that doesn't have a receiver to read from it. When data is sent to a leaky buffer but no one is there to receive it, it can cause the program to deadlock or consume excessive memory.

```go
package main

func main() {
  ch := make(chan int, 1) // Buffered channel with capacity 1
  ch <- 1 // Send data to the channel
  // No receiver to read from the channel
}
```

It's important to ensure that all data sent to buffered channels is eventually consumed to prevent leaks.

Concurrency in Go is a powerful feature that enables developers to write efficient and scalable concurrent programs. By using goroutines, channels, and parallelization techniques, Go programs can effectively utilize multicore CPUs and handle concurrent tasks with ease.
