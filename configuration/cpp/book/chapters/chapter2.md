# STANDARD LIBRARY (HEADERS)

In C++, the Standard Library provides a rich set of functionalities encapsulated in various header files. Here's an explanation of some commonly used headers in the Standard Library:

1. **iostream**: This header provides input and output streams, including `cin`, `cout`, `cerr`, and `clog`, for handling input and output operations. It also includes functionalities for formatting output.

2. **vector**: The vector header provides the `std::vector` class, which is a dynamic array that can resize itself automatically when needed. It supports random access and efficient insertion/removal of elements at the end.

3. **string**: This header provides the `std::string` class for handling strings of characters. It offers various operations such as concatenation, substring extraction, searching, and comparison.

4. **algorithm**: The algorithm header contains a collection of functions for performing common algorithms on containers, such as sorting (`std::sort`), searching (`std::find`), and manipulating ranges (`std::copy`, `std::transform`).

5. **utility**: This header provides various utility functions and classes, including `std::pair` for storing pairs of values, `std::move` for enabling move semantics, and `std::swap` for swapping values.

6. **cmath**: This header provides mathematical functions for floating-point numbers, such as trigonometric functions (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`), logarithmic functions (`log`, `log10`), and exponential functions (`exp`, `pow`).

7. **fstream**: The fstream header provides classes for file input and output operations, including `std::ifstream` for reading from files, `std::ofstream` for writing to files, and `std::fstream` for both reading and writing.

8. **iomanip**: This header provides manipulators for formatting input and output operations, such as `std::setw` for setting the width of output fields, `std::setprecision` for setting the precision of floating-point numbers, and `std::fixed` for fixed-point notation.

9. **sstream**: The sstream header provides classes for string-based input and output operations, including `std::stringstream` and `std::istringstream` for parsing and formatting strings.

10. **ctime**: This header provides functions for working with date and time, such as `std::time` for getting the current time, `std::localtime` for converting a time value to a local time representation, and `std::strftime` for formatting time as a string.

These are just a few examples of the headers available in the C++ Standard Library. Each header provides a set of functionalities related to a specific aspect of programming, making it easier for developers to write efficient and portable code.
