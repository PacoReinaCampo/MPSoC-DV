# DIAGNOSTICS LIBRARY

The Diagnostics library in C++ provides functionalities for handling errors, exceptions, and diagnostic information within programs. Let's delve into the components you've mentioned:

## EXCEPTION âˆ’ SYSTEM ERROR

The `exception` component of the Diagnostics library deals with error handling in C++. It provides a standardized way to represent and handle exceptional conditions that may arise during program execution. This includes the definition of standard exception classes such as `std::exception` and its derived classes like `std::runtime_error`, `std::logic_error`, etc.

- **std::exception**: The base class for all standard C++ exceptions. It defines the virtual function `what()` which returns a C-style string describing the exception.
- **std::runtime_error**: Represents errors detected during runtime, typically due to conditions beyond the program's control (e.g., file not found).
- **std::logic_error**: Represents errors caused by logical errors in the program's logic (e.g., invalid argument).

Additionally, the `system_error` component allows for handling errors reported by the operating system or the C++ Standard Library functions. It wraps error codes returned by system calls or library functions and provides information about the error condition.

## BASIC_STACKTRACE (C++23)

The `basic_stacktrace` component, introduced in C++23, provides a mechanism to capture and represent stack traces in C++ programs. Stack traces contain information about the call stack at a given point in program execution, including function names, file names, and line numbers. This information is invaluable for debugging and diagnosing runtime errors and exceptions.

- **std::basic_stacktrace**: A template class representing a stack trace. It provides methods to capture the current stack trace and query information about individual stack frames.

Together, these components of the Diagnostics library empower C++ developers with robust tools for error handling, exception management, and runtime diagnostics, enhancing the reliability and maintainability of C++ programs.
