# SMART POINTERS

Here's a breakdown of each topic:

## USING `BOX<T>` TO POINT TO DATA ON THE HEAP

In Rust, `Box<T>` is a smart pointer that points to data stored on the heap. It provides a way to allocate memory on the heap and ensures that the memory is freed when the `Box` goes out of scope. `Box` is commonly used when you need to:
- Have a value with a known size at compile time.
- Transfer ownership of a large amount of data.
- Have data that you want to have a known lifetime.

```rust
fn main() {
    let b = Box::new(5);
    println!("Value: {}", b);
}
```

In this example, `Box::new(5)` allocates memory on the heap to store the value `5`, and `b` is a smart pointer (box) that points to this memory location.

## TREATING SMART POINTERS LIKE REGULAR REFERENCES WITH THE `DEREF` TRAIT

In Rust, the `Deref` trait allows you to customize the behavior of the dereference operator (`*`). It enables smart pointers to be used like regular references, allowing you to access the inner value of the smart pointer as if it were a reference.

```rust
use std::ops::Deref;

struct MyBox<T>(T);

impl<T> Deref for MyBox<T> {
    type Target = T;

    fn deref(&self) -> &T {
        &self.0
    }
}

fn main() {
    let my_box = MyBox(5);
    assert_eq!(5, *my_box); // Works like a regular reference
}
```

In this example, `MyBox` is a custom smart pointer that implements the `Deref` trait, allowing you to dereference it using the `*` operator.

## RUNNING CODE ON CLEANUP WITH THE `DROP` TRAIT

The `Drop` trait in Rust allows you to run code when a value goes out of scope. It is similar to a destructor in other languages and is commonly used to perform cleanup tasks such as releasing resources or closing file handles.

```rust
struct CustomSmartPointer {
    data: String,
}

impl Drop for CustomSmartPointer {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("Dropping CustomSmartPointer with data `{}`", self.data);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let c = CustomSmartPointer { data: String::from("some data") };
    println!("CustomSmartPointer created.");

    // c goes out of scope and Drop trait's drop method is called
}
```

In this example, when `c` goes out of scope at the end of `main()`, the `drop()` method of the `Drop` trait is automatically called, printing a message indicating that the smart pointer is being dropped.

## `RC<T>`, THE REFERENCE COUNTED SMART POINTER

`Rc<T>` (Reference Counted) is a smart pointer in Rust that enables multiple ownership of the same data. It keeps track of the number of references to the data it points to and automatically frees the memory when the last reference is dropped.

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
    let data = Rc::new(5);
    let data1 = Rc::clone(&data);
    let data2 = Rc::clone(&data);

    // data, data1, and data2 all point to the same value on the heap
}
```

In this example, `Rc::new(5)` creates an `Rc` smart pointer to the value `5`. Using `Rc::clone()`, we can create additional references to the same data.

## `REFCELL<T>` AND THE INTERIOR MUTABILITY PATTERN

`RefCell<T>` is a smart pointer in Rust that enables interior mutability, allowing you to mutate the value it holds even when it's behind an immutable reference. It enforces Rust's borrowing rules at runtime rather than compile time.

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;

fn main() {
    let data = RefCell::new(5);
    let mut value = data.borrow_mut();
    *value += 1;
}
```

In this example, `RefCell::new(5)` creates a `RefCell` containing the value `5`. We can borrow a mutable reference to the value using `borrow_mut()`, even though `data` is immutable. This is possible because `RefCell` enforces borrowing rules at runtime.

## REFERENCE CYCLES CAN LEAK MEMORY

In Rust, reference cycles occur when two or more smart pointers reference each other, creating a cycle. Reference cycles can lead to memory leaks because the reference counts of the smart pointers never reach zero, preventing the memory from being deallocated.

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;
use std::cell::RefCell;

fn main() {
    let a = Rc::new(RefCell::new(5));
    let b = Rc::new(RefCell::new(10));

    *a.borrow_mut() = Rc::clone(&b);
    *b.borrow_mut() = Rc::clone(&a);

    // Reference cycle created between a and b
}
```

In this example, `a` and `b` reference each other through `Rc` and `RefCell`, creating a reference cycle. Since the reference counts of `a` and `b` will never reach zero, the memory they point to will never be deallocated, leading to a memory leak.
