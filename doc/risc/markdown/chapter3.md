# ARCHITECTURAL OVERVIEW

The IEEE 1754-1994 Standard provides a comprehensive framework for the design of 32-bit microprocessor architectures, aiming to ensure compatibility and interoperability among different implementations. The architecture is designed to support high-performance computing while maintaining simplicity and efficiency.

## IEEE 1754 PROCESSOR

The IEEE 1754 processor architecture includes several key components: the Integer Unit (IU), the Floating-Point Unit (FPU), and the Coprocessor (CP). Each of these units has specific functions that contribute to the overall performance and capability of the processor.

### Integer Unit (IU)

The Integer Unit is responsible for executing integer arithmetic and logical operations. Key features of the IU include:

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of integer values.
- **Logical Operations**: AND, OR, XOR, NOT operations.
- **Shift Operations**: Logical and arithmetic shifts, and rotations.
- **Condition Codes**: Status flags to indicate the result of the last operation (e.g., zero, carry, overflow, negative).

### Floating-Point Unit (FPU)

The Floating-Point Unit handles arithmetic operations on floating-point numbers. It conforms to the IEEE 754 standard, ensuring consistent and accurate floating-point calculations. Key features of the FPU include:

- **Floating-Point Arithmetic**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square root operations.
- **Rounding Modes**: Support for various rounding modes as defined by IEEE 754.
- **Special Values**: Handling of special values such as NaN (Not-a-Number), positive and negative infinity.

### Coprocessor (CP)

The Coprocessor extends the functionality of the main processor by providing additional specialized operations. It can be used for tasks such as complex mathematical computations, graphics processing, or cryptographic operations. Key features of the CP include:

- **Custom Instructions**: Ability to execute a set of instructions that are not part of the standard ISA.
- **Parallel Processing**: Offloading certain tasks to the coprocessor to improve performance.

## INSTRUCTIONS

The IEEE 1754-1994 Standard defines a comprehensive set of instructions categorized into various types based on their functionality.

### Memory Access

Memory access instructions are used to load data from memory into registers and store data from registers into memory. Key instructions include:

- **Load (LD)**: Load data from memory into a register.
- **Store (ST)**: Store data from a register into memory.
- **Load/Store Multiple**: Instructions to load or store multiple registers in a single operation for efficiency.

### Arithmetic/Logical/Shift

These instructions perform arithmetic and logical operations on integer values, as well as bitwise shifts. Key instructions include:

- **Add (ADD), Subtract (SUB), Multiply (MUL), Divide (DIV)**: Basic arithmetic operations.
- **AND, OR, XOR, NOT**: Logical operations.
- **Shift Left (SHL), Shift Right (SHR), Rotate (ROL, ROR)**: Bitwise shift and rotate operations.

### Control Transfer

Control transfer instructions change the flow of execution in the program. Key instructions include:

- **Jump (JMP), Call (CALL), Return (RET)**: Unconditional transfer of control.
- **Conditional Branches**: Branches based on the evaluation of condition codes (e.g., BEQ for branch if equal, BNE for branch if not equal).
- **Loop Control**: Instructions to facilitate loop implementation (e.g., decrement and branch if not zero).

### State Register Access

These instructions provide access to special-purpose registers that control the state of the processor. Key instructions include:

- **Move to/from State Register (MSR, MFSR)**: Instructions to read from or write to state registers.
- **Set/Clear Flags**: Instructions to manipulate specific bits in state registers.

### Floating-Point Operate (FPop)

Floating-point operate instructions are used to perform arithmetic operations on floating-point numbers. Key instructions include:

- **Floating-Point Add (FADD), Subtract (FSUB), Multiply (FMUL), Divide (FDIV)**: Basic floating-point arithmetic operations.
- **Square Root (FSQRT)**: Compute the square root of a floating-point number.
- **Conversion Instructions**: Convert between different floating-point formats or between floating-point and integer formats.

### Coprocessor Operate (CPop)

Coprocessor operate instructions are used to perform operations specific to the coprocessor. These instructions extend the functionality of the processor by leveraging the specialized capabilities of the coprocessor. Key instructions include:

- **Coprocessor Load/Store (CPLD, CPST)**: Load data from or store data to the coprocessor.
- **Coprocessor Arithmetic**: Perform arithmetic operations using the coprocessor.
- **Coprocessor Control**: Instructions to control the operation and state of the coprocessor.

## TRAPS

Traps are special instructions used to handle exceptional conditions and system calls. They interrupt the normal flow of execution and transfer control to a trap handler. Key traps include:

- **System Call (SCALL)**: Trigger a system call to request services from the operating system.
- **Software Interrupt (SWI)**: Generate a software interrupt for various purposes.
- **Arithmetic Exception (AEXC)**: Handle arithmetic exceptions such as division by zero or overflow.

Understanding these components and instructions is crucial for effectively designing, programming, and optimizing systems based on the IEEE 1754-1994 standard.
