# TRAPS

Traps in the IEEE 1754-1994 standard refer to the mechanisms by which the processor handles exceptional conditions, interrupts, and errors. They allow the processor to interrupt normal execution flow to address these events, ensuring the system's reliability and stability.

## TRAP CATEGORIES

### Reset Trap

- **Reset Trap**: This is a special type of trap that occurs when the system is powered on or when a reset signal is received. It initializes the processor to a known state, ensuring a clean startup.

### Precise Trap

- **Precise Trap**: Occurs synchronously with instruction execution. When a precise trap is taken, the processor ensures that the program counter (PC) points to the exact instruction causing the trap, and all preceding instructions are fully executed while subsequent instructions are not started.

### Deferred Trap

- **Deferred Trap**: Similar to precise traps, but they may occur after a small number of instructions have been executed. Deferred traps are often used for performance reasons, allowing the processor to continue executing a few more instructions before handling the trap.

### Disrupting Trap

- **Disrupting Trap**: Causes an immediate halt to instruction execution. These are typically severe errors or critical interrupts that require urgent attention. The system state may not be fully preserved, and recovery might involve more complex handling.

## TRAP MODEL

The trap model defines how traps are detected, prioritized, and handled. The processor includes mechanisms for detecting various types of traps, determining their priorities, and invoking the appropriate trap handlers.

## TRAP CONTROL

### ET and PIL Control

- **ET (Enable Traps)**: A bit in the processor state register that enables or disables the handling of traps. When ET is clear, traps are ignored.
- **PIL (Processor Interrupt Level)**: Specifies the current interrupt level. Only traps with a priority higher than the current PIL are processed.

### TEM Control

- **TEM (Trap Enable Mask)**: A mask that specifies which traps are enabled. Each bit corresponds to a specific trap type, allowing fine-grained control over trap handling.

## TRAP IDENTIFICATION

Trap identification involves determining the type and source of the trap. This is crucial for invoking the correct trap handler and managing the system state appropriately.

### Trap Type (tt)

- **Trap Type (tt)**: An identifier that specifies the cause of the trap. The tt field is used by the trap handler to determine the appropriate response.

### Trap Priorities

Trap priorities determine the order in which multiple simultaneous traps are handled. Higher priority traps preempt lower priority ones, ensuring critical conditions are addressed first.

## TRAP DEFINITION

### Reset Trap

- **Reset Trap**: This is the highest priority trap and initializes the processor state. The reset trap handler sets up the system's initial configuration, including the stack pointer, program counter, and essential registers.

### Non-Reset Traps

- **Non-Reset Traps**: These include a wide range of traps such as exceptions, interrupts, and software-initiated traps. Each non-reset trap has a specific handler that deals with its particular condition.

### Error_State

- **Error_State**: Represents the condition when the processor encounters an unrecoverable error. The error state triggers a disrupting trap, signaling the need for a critical response.

### Processor Execution State Changes Upon Traps

- **State Changes**: When a trap occurs, the processor's execution state changes to reflect the trap condition. This includes saving the current program counter, updating the trap base register, and possibly altering other control registers.

### Exception/Interrupt Descriptions

- **Exceptions**: Synchronous events caused by the execution of an instruction (e.g., division by zero, invalid memory access).
- **Interrupts**: Asynchronous events triggered by external devices or internal timers, requiring immediate attention (e.g., hardware interrupts).

## TRAP ACTIONS

Trap actions are the steps taken by the processor to handle traps:

1. **Save State**: The processor saves the current state, including the program counter and relevant registers, to preserve the execution context.
2. **Identify Trap**: The trap type (tt) and source are identified using control registers and status bits.
3. **Invoke Handler**: The appropriate trap handler is invoked based on the trap type and priority.
4. **Execute Handler**: The trap handler performs necessary actions, such as error correction, state restoration, or specific responses to the trap condition.
5. **Restore State**: After handling the trap, the processor restores the saved state and resumes normal execution, unless the trap handler dictates otherwise.
