
Title: UVM 1800.2-2017 Class Reference

This library implements the API as documented in the IEEE 1800.2-2017 standard.  Documentation for that API is in the standard.  In addition, this library also implements user-facing APIs that go beyond the standard.  

These APIs are documented here and include both APIs that are being considered for contribution to the IEEE by Accellera and APIs that are provided for debug purposes and not being considered for contribution to the IEEE.  

The documentation uses the tags "@uvm-contrib" and "@uvm-accellera" to differentiate between the two sets of APIs.

An additional note, certain terms in the documentation may be surrounded by less than/greater than symbols, such as "<uvm_object>". This is an indication that the documentation is referring to a construct defined in the 1800.2 LRM.
