# IMPLEMENTATION

INSERT HERE

## IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS

The implementation process uses the detailed design data to produce the hardware item that is an input to the testing activity.

### Implementation Objectives

The objectives of the implementation process are:

1. A hardware item is produced which implements the hardware detailed design using representative manufacturing processes.

2. The hardware item implementation, assembly and installation data is complete.

3. Derived requirements are fed back to the detailed design process or other appropriate processes.

4. Requirement omissions and errors are provided to the appropriate processes for resolution.

### Implementation Activities

Guidance for the implementation activities includes:

1. A hardware item should be produced using the design data and, where practical, the resources intended for the production product. This may include procurement, kitting, build, inspection and test.

2. Derived requirements generated by the implementation process should be fed back to the detailed design process or other appropriate processes.

3. Omissions and errors discovered during the implementation process should be provided to the appropriate process for resolution.

## PRODUCTION TRANSITION PROCESS

In this process, manufacturing data, test facilities and general resources should be examined to ensure availability and suitability for production. The production transition process uses the outputs from the implementation and verification processes to move the product into production.

### Production Transition Objectives

The objectives of this process are:

1. A baseline is established that includes all design and manufacturing data needed to support the consistent replication of the hardware item.

2. Manufacturing requirements related to safety are identified and documented and manufacturing controls are established.

3. Derived requirements are fed back to the implementation process or other appropriate processes.

4. Errors and omissions are provided to the appropriate processes for resolution.

### Production Transition Activities

Guidance for the production transition activities includes:

1. Manufacturing data should be prepared from configured design data.

2. Manufacturing data should be checked for completeness and consistency with the configured design data.

   Note: It is beyond the scope of this document to impose any conditions on the nature of the manufacturing build documentation.

3. Any changes or improvements that are incorporated during the production transition process should be evaluated to ensure they adhere to all product requirements, especially safety requirements. Any changes not compliant with customer or certification requirements should be approved by the relevant parties.

4. Manufacturing requirements pertaining to safety should be explicitly defined so they can be controlled during the production process.

5. Data required to develop acceptance test criteria should be determined.

6. Omissions or errors that are identified should be provided to the appropriate process for resolution.

## ACCEPTANCE TEST

An acceptance test demonstrates that the manufactured, modified or repaired product performs in compliance with the key attributes of the unit on which certification is based. These key attributes are chosen using engineering judgement and are indicative that the product is capable of meeting the requirements to which the unit was developed.

Note 1: Configuration control of the "as built" product is not a function to be performed by the acceptance test activity. The configuration management plan, as described in Section 7 of this document, should describe how the applicant plans to perform this activity.

The scope of this document does include the determination of the acceptance test criteria, including pass/fail conditions. Production activities, including acceptance testing, are considered to be outside the scope of this document

Note 2: An acceptance test is not intended to verify all requirements on each production unit.

Subitem testing may be used as a part of the acceptance test.

Acceptance test criteria should ensure that:

1. Electrical tests are identified.

2. Environmental screening tests are identified when necessary.

3. The acceptance test provides coverage of those design aspects necessary to meet the safety requirements. Safety related item or subitems that are not covered by the test should be identified and other assurance means provided. These means may include analysis, design control, statistical process control or other means as appropriate.

## SERIES PRODUCTION

This process is not within the scope of this document, but elements impacting design assurance are briefly described to complete the life cycle.

This process reproduces the hardware item on a routine basis that complies with the production data and requirements.

Considerations include:

1. Management of change of the production processes or the design provides assurance that change does not adversely impact existing safety or certification or compliance to the requirements.

   Note: In addition to the guidance proposed by the body of the document, Section 11.1.1 covers Modifications to Previously Developed Hardware. When addressing component obsolescence, refer to Section 11.2.

2. Updating of all documentation related to changes is performed in compliance with approved configuration management plans.

**A. FRONT-END ENGINEERING**

**1. System Level (SystemC/SystemVerilog)**

The System Level abstraction of a system only looks at its biggest building blocks like processing units or peripheral devices. At this level the circuit is usually described using traditional programming languages like SystemC or SystemVerilog. Sometimes special software libraries are used that are aimed at simulation circuits on the system level. The IEEE 1685-2009 standard defines the IP-XACT file format that can be used to represent designs on the system level and building blocks that can be used in such system level designs.

**2. Behavioral & Register Transfer Level (VHDL/Verilog)**

At the Behavioural Level abstraction a language aimed at hardware description such as Verilog or VHDL is used to describe the circuit, but so-called behavioural modeling is used in at least part of the circuit description. In behavioural modeling there must be a language feature that allows for imperative programming to be used to describe data paths and registers. This is the always -block in Verilog and the process -block in VHDL.

A design in Register Transfer Level representation is usually stored using HDLs like Verilog and VHDL. But only a very limited subset of features is used, namely minimalistic always blocks (Verilog) or process blocks (VHDL) that model the register type used and unconditional assignments for the datapath logic. The use of HDLs on this level simplifies simulation as no additional tools are required to simulate a design in Register Transfer Level representation.

**B. BACK-END ENGINEERING**

**3. Logical Gate**

At the Logical Gate Level the design is represented by a netlist that uses only cells from a small number of single-bit cells, such as basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, etc.) and registers (usually D-Type Flip-flops). A number of netlist formats exists that can be used on this level such as the Electronic Design Interchange Format (EDIF), but for ease of simulation often a HDL netlist is used. The latter is a HDL file (Verilog or VHDL) that only uses the most basic language constructs for instantiation and connecting of cells.

**4. Physical Gate**

On the Physical Gate Level only gates are used that are physically available on the target architecture. In some cases this may only be NAND, NOR and NOT gates as well as D-Type registers. In the case of an FPGA-based design the Physical Gate Level representation is a netlist of LUTs with optional output registers, as these are the basic building blocks of FPGA logic cells.

**5. Switch Level**

A Switch Level representation of a circuit is a netlist utilizing single transistors as cells. Switch Level modeling is possible in Verilog and VHDL, but is seldom used in modern designs, as in modern digital ASIC or FPGA flows the physical gates are considered the atomic build blocks of the logic circuit.

### Simulating Switch Level of Hardware

*A Standard Cell Simulator treats transistors as ideal switches. Extracted capacitance and lumped resistance values are used to make the switch a little bit more realistic than the ideal, using the RC time constants to predict the relative timing of events. This simulator represents a circuit in terms of its exact transistor structure but describes the electrical behavior in a highly idealized way.*

### Verifying Switch Level of Hardware LVS

*A Standard Cell Verifier compares netlists, a process known as LVS (Layout vs. Schematic). This step ensures that the geometry that has been laid out matches the expected circuit. The greatest need for LVS is in large analog or mixed-signal circuits that cannot be simulated in reasonable time. LVS can be done faster than simulation, and provides feedback that makes it easier to find errors.*

### Checking Switch Level of Hardware DRC

*A Standard Cell Checker is a geometric constraint imposed on Printed Circuit Board (PCB) and Integrated Circuit (IC) designers to ensure their designs function properly, reliably, and can be produced with acceptable yield. Design Rules for production are developed by hardware engineers based on the capability of their processes to realize design intent. Design Rule Checking (DRC) is used to ensure that designers do not violate design rules.*
