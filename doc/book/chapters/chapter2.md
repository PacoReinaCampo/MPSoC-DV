# WORKPATH

A toolchain is a collection of programming tools used to create a software product or system, typically for a specific target platform or architecture. In the context of embedded systems and hardware development, this includes compilers to translate high-level code, assemblers for low-level instructions, linkers to combine code modules, debuggers for troubleshooting, and simulators or emulators for testing before deploying on physical hardware. The choice of toolchain is critical as it directly impacts development efficiency, code optimization, and compatibility with the target hardware.

## HARDWARE

The hardware development process involves translating a conceptual design into a physical electronic circuit or system. This encompasses various stages, starting from Register Transfer Level (RTL) design using hardware description languages like Verilog or VHDL, followed by synthesis to convert the RTL code into a gate-level netlist. Subsequent steps include place and route (P&R) to physically arrange the gates and interconnects on the silicon die or FPGA fabric, and finally, verification and testing to ensure the hardware functions correctly according to specifications. This process targets specific hardware platforms such as Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) or Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).

type:

```bash
cd synthesis/yosys
source synthesize.sh
```

This command sequence navigates into a directory presumably containing hardware design files and configuration for the Yosys synthesis tool. Executing the `synthesize.sh` script initiates the synthesis process using Yosys, an open-source framework for Verilog RTL synthesis. It reads the hardware description, performs logic optimization and technology mapping, and generates a gate-level netlist representing the design using standard logic cells or primitives specific to the target technology (ASIC standard cell library or FPGA architecture).

### ASIC for Design

Hello QueenField in C Language:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello QueenField!\n");
  return 0;
}
```

This standard C "Hello QueenField!" program, when compiled for bare-metal OpenRISC, requires a runtime environment or simulator that provides basic I/O functionality. The `printf` function needs to be mapped to a simulated UART or a specific hardware UART if running on an FPGA or ASIC. This typically involves linking with a minimal C library (like newlib) configured for the target and implementing low-level character output routines within the board support package (BSP) or simulator environment.

type:

```bash
rm -rf hello_c.elf
rm -rf hello_c.hex

export PATH=/opt/or1k-elf-gcc/bin:${PATH}

or1k-elf-gcc -o hello_c.elf hello_c.c
or1k-elf-objcopy -O ihex hello_c.elf hello_c.hex
```

This script first removes any previous build artifacts (`hello_c.elf`, `hello_c.hex`). It then ensures the OpenRISC cross-compiler (`or1k-elf-gcc`) is in the system's PATH. The `or1k-elf-gcc` command compiles the C source file (`hello_c.c`) into an ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) binary (`hello_c.elf`), linking it with necessary startup code and libraries for the bare-metal target. Finally, `or1k-elf-objcopy` converts the ELF file into the Intel HEX format (`hello_c.hex`), which is often used for programming EPROMs or loading into simulators/debuggers that don't directly support ELF.

type:

```bash
export PATH=/opt/or1k-elf-gcc/bin:${PATH}

or1k-sim -f or1ksim.cfg hello_c.elf
```

This command executes the compiled OpenRISC C program using `or1k-sim`, the official architectural simulator for OpenRISC. It first ensures the simulator (which might be part of the GCC toolchain installation path) is accessible. The `-f or1ksim.cfg` argument tells the simulator to load configuration settings from the `or1ksim.cfg` file, which typically defines the simulated memory map, peripherals (like a UART for output), and other system parameters. The simulator then loads and runs the `hello_c.elf` executable file, printing the "Hello QueenField!" message to the simulated console if I/O is correctly configured.

##### C++ Language

...

C++ language support for OpenRISC in a bare metal environment enables developers to utilize object-oriented programming techniques while maintaining direct hardware control. This facilitates the creation of modular, maintainable, and reusable code, leveraging C++'s advanced features such as classes, inheritance, and templates.

Hello QueenField in C++ Language:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello QueenField!\n";
  return 0;
}
```

Similar to C, running this C++ "Hello QueenField!" program on bare-metal OpenRISC requires retargeting the standard output stream (`std::cout`). This involves implementing the necessary low-level character output functions (e.g., writing to a UART) and integrating them with the C++ standard library's stream buffer mechanisms. The OpenRISC C++ cross-compiler (`or1k-elf-g++`) is used for compilation, and careful consideration must be given to the code size impact of C++ features and libraries, often requiring compiler options to disable exceptions and RTTI and linking against a suitable C++ runtime library like libstdc++.

type:

```bash
rm -rf hello_cpp.elf
rm -rf hello_cpp.hex

export PATH=/opt/or1k-elf-g++/bin:${PATH}

or1k-elf-gcc -o hello_cpp.elf hello_cpp.cpp
or1k-elf-objcopy -O ihex hello_cpp.elf hello_cpp.hex
```

This script prepares for and builds the C++ application. It removes old build files, ensures the OpenRISC C++ cross-compiler (`or1k-elf-g++`) is accessible via the PATH (note: the script incorrectly shows `or1k-elf-gcc` in the `export` but likely intends `or1k-elf-g++`, and uses `or1k-elf-gcc` for compilation which should be `or1k-elf-g++`). The compiler command processes the C++ source file (`hello_cpp.cpp`), linking it with the C++ runtime and standard libraries to produce the ELF executable (`hello_cpp.elf`). Finally, `or1k-elf-objcopy` converts this ELF file into the Intel HEX format (`hello_cpp.hex`) for deployment or simulation.

type:

```bash
export PATH=/opt/or1k-elf-g++/bin:${PATH}

or1k-sim -f or1ksim.cfg hello_cpp.elf
```

This command runs the compiled OpenRISC C++ application using the `or1k-sim` simulator. It ensures the simulator and potentially the C++ runtime libraries are findable via the PATH. Using the configuration file `or1ksim.cfg` to set up the simulated environment (memory, peripherals), it loads and executes the `hello_cpp.elf` file. If the standard output stream has been correctly retargeted in the C++ runtime support and the simulator configuration provides a suitable output device (like a simulated UART), the "Hello QueenField!" message will be displayed.

By rigorously testing the ISA 32, developers can identify and address potential issues, optimizing the processor's performance and ensuring that it meets the demands of various applications, from embedded systems to more complex computing tasks.

elf2hex.sh:

```bash
riscv32-unknown-elf-objcopy -O ihex rv32mi-p-breakpoint rv32mi-p-breakpoint.hex
riscv32-unknown-elf-objcopy -O ihex rv32mi-p-csr rv32mi-p-csr.hex

...
riscv32-unknown-elf-objcopy -O ihex rv32um-v-remw rv32um-v-remw.hex
```

This `elf2hex.sh` script automates the conversion of compiled RISC-V 32-bit test programs from ELF format to Intel HEX format. For each test case (e.g., `rv32mi-p-breakpoint`, `rv32mi-p-csr`), it invokes the `riscv32-unknown-elf-objcopy` utility with the `-O ihex` option. This generates a corresponding `.hex` file containing the program's machine code in a text-based format suitable for loading into memory simulators, FPGA memory initializers, or PROM programmers. The script processes numerous tests covering different instruction subsets (like base integer 'I', multiplication 'M', CSR instructions).

type:

```bash
export PATH=/opt/riscv-elf-gcc/bin:${PATH}

spike rv32mi-p-breakpoint
spike rv32mi-p-csr

...
spike rv32um-v-remw
```

These commands execute individual RISC-V 32-bit architectural tests using Spike, the official RISC-V ISA simulator. After ensuring Spike is in the PATH, each command runs a specific test case (e.g., `rv32mi-p-breakpoint`, `rv32mi-p-csr`). Spike loads the ELF file for the test, simulates its execution according to the RISC-V specification, and typically relies on the test program itself to indicate success or failure through specific exit codes or memory writes, thus verifying the simulator's (and indirectly, the specification's) behavior for that instruction or sequence.

##### ISA 64

...

The ISA 64 tests for RISC-V extend the evaluation to the 64-bit instruction set architecture, providing a comprehensive assessment of its capabilities. These tests cover all aspects of the 64-bit ISA, including arithmetic, control flow, and memory operations. Conducting rigorous ISA 64 tests ensures that RISC-V processors deliver the necessary performance and reliability for high-performance computing and advanced applications, addressing the needs of more demanding computational tasks.

elf2hex.sh:

```bash
riscv64-unknown-elf-objcopy -O ihex rv64mi-p-breakpoint rv64mi-p-breakpoint.hex
riscv64-unknown-elf-objcopy -O ihex rv64mi-p-csr rv64mi-p-csr.hex

...
riscv64-unknown-elf-objcopy -O ihex rv64um-v-remw rv64um-v-remw.hex
```

This version of the `elf2hex.sh` script performs the same function as the 32-bit one but targets the 64-bit RISC-V architecture (RV64). It uses the `riscv64-unknown-elf-objcopy` utility to convert the compiled 64-bit test ELF files (e.g., `rv64mi-p-breakpoint`, `rv64mi-p-csr`) into the Intel HEX format. These HEX files contain the machine code for the RV64 tests and are used for loading into simulators or hardware memory systems designed for the 64-bit architecture.

type:

```bash
export PATH=/opt/riscv-elf-gcc/bin:${PATH}

spike rv64mi-p-breakpoint
spike rv64mi-p-csr

...
spike rv64um-v-remw
```

These commands utilize the Spike simulator to execute the compiled 64-bit RISC-V architectural tests. Each command runs a specific RV64 test case (e.g., `rv64mi-p-breakpoint`, `rv64mi-p-csr`). Spike simulates the execution of these 64-bit instructions, verifying their behavior against the RISC-V ISA specification for RV64. As with the 32-bit tests, the test programs themselves typically contain self-checking mechanisms to report pass or fail status upon completion.

##### ISA 128

...

The ISA 128 tests for RISC-V focus on the 128-bit instruction set architecture, designed to support larger address spaces and higher precision computations than the 64-bit variant. These tests evaluate the functionality and performance of the 128-bit ISA, ensuring that it meets the requirements of advanced scientific computing, cryptographic applications, and other data-intensive tasks. By thoroughly testing the ISA 128, developers can ensure that RISC-V processors are future-proofed and capable of handling emerging computational demands.

elf2hex.sh:

```bash
riscv128-unknown-elf-objcopy -O ihex rv128mi-p-breakpoint rv128mi-p-breakpoint.hex
riscv128-unknown-elf-objcopy -O ihex rv128mi-p-csr rv128mi-p-csr.hex

...
riscv128-unknown-elf-objcopy -O ihex rv128um-v-remw rv128um-v-remw.hex
```

This script is intended for the experimental or future 128-bit RISC-V architecture (RV128). It would use a hypothetical `riscv128-unknown-elf-objcopy` tool to convert compiled 128-bit test ELF files (e.g., `rv128mi-p-breakpoint`) into Intel HEX format. This prepares the test code for simulators or hardware platforms that support the RV128 ISA, allowing validation of the 128-bit instruction set extensions and behavior.

type:

```bash
export PATH=/opt/riscv-elf-gcc/bin:${PATH}

spike rv128mi-p-breakpoint
spike rv128mi-p-csr

...
spike rv128um-v-remw
```

These commands demonstrate how the Spike simulator would be used to run 128-bit RISC-V architectural tests, assuming Spike has been extended to support the RV128 ISA. Each command executes a specific RV128 test case (e.g., `rv128mi-p-breakpoint`). The simulator would load the 128-bit ELF file and simulate the execution of RV128 instructions, verifying their correctness against the (potentially evolving) specification for this architecture variant.

#### RISC-V BareMetal

Bare-metal programming is fundamental for RISC-V development, especially for deeply embedded systems, microcontroller applications, or initial hardware bring-up. It involves writing software that directly interacts with the hardware without an OS. Developers use RISC-V cross-compilers (GCC, Clang), define memory layouts via linker scripts, write startup code for initialization, and manage interrupts and peripherals directly through memory-mapped registers. Simulators like Spike or QEMU, along with hardware debuggers (JTAG/OpenOCD), are essential tools.

##### C Language

...

C language support for RISC-V in a bare metal environment involves developing software that runs directly on the hardware without an operating system. This approach provides maximum control over the processor's resources, enabling the creation of highly optimized and efficient applications. Writing bare metal code in C for RISC-V allows developers to leverage the simplicity and portability of the C language, ensuring robust and reliable software for a wide range of embedded and real-time applications.

Hello QueenField in C Language:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello QueenField!\n");
  return 0;
}
```

Compiling and running this C "Hello QueenField!" program on bare-metal RISC-V requires a cross-compiler (e.g., `riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc`) and a way to handle the `printf` output. Typically, this involves linking with a C library like `newlib` and providing low-level implementations for system calls, particularly the `write` system call, which `printf` uses. This implementation would write characters to a UART or a console managed by a simulator (like Spike or QEMU) or debugger.

type:

```bash
rm -rf hello_c.elf
rm -rf hello_c.hex

export PATH=/opt/riscv-elf-gcc/bin:${PATH}

riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -o hello_c.elf hello_c.c
riscv64-unknown-elf-objcopy -O ihex hello_c.elf hello_c.hex
```

This script builds the bare-metal C application for a 64-bit RISC-V target. It first cleans previous build artifacts. It ensures the RISC-V 64-bit cross-compiler (`riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc`) is in the PATH. The `gcc` command compiles `hello_c.c` and links it with the necessary C library and startup code to produce the ELF executable `hello_c.elf`. Finally, `objcopy` converts the ELF file to Intel HEX format (`hello_c.hex`), suitable for loading into hardware or certain simulation environments.

type:

```bash
export PATH=/opt/riscv-elf-gcc/bin:${PATH}

spike pk hello_c.elf
```

This command executes the compiled bare-metal C application (`hello_c.elf`) using the Spike RISC-V simulator. The `pk` argument instructs Spike to load the Proxy Kernel (pk). The Proxy Kernel is a lightweight execution environment that runs in machine mode and provides basic system call handling (like file I/O, which `printf` eventually uses) for user-mode applications running on Spike. This allows standard C library functions that rely on system calls to work within the simulation environment without requiring a full operating system.

##### C++ Language

...

C++ language support for RISC-V in a bare metal environment enables developers to utilize object-oriented programming techniques while maintaining direct hardware control. This facilitates the creation of modular, maintainable, and reusable code, leveraging C++'s advanced features such as classes, inheritance, and templates. Bare metal programming in C++ on RISC-V combines the performance and efficiency of low-level programming with the flexibility and abstraction of high-level language constructs, making it suitable for complex embedded systems.

Hello QueenField in C++ Language:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello QueenField!\n";
  return 0;
}
```

To run this C++ "Hello QueenField!" program on bare-metal RISC-V, the `iostream` library's output mechanism (`std::cout`) needs to be connected to a physical output device or simulator console. This requires using a RISC-V C++ cross-compiler (e.g., `riscv64-unknown-elf-g++`), linking against the C++ standard library (`libstdc++`), and providing implementations for the underlying system calls (like `write`) that the library uses for output, similar to the C bare-metal setup. Careful management of C++ features (exceptions, RTTI) is needed to control code size.

type:

```bash
rm -rf hello_cpp.elf
rm -rf hello_cpp.hex

export PATH=/opt/riscv-elf-gcc/bin:${PATH}

riscv64-unknown-elf-g++ -o hello_cpp.elf hello_cpp.cpp
riscv64-unknown-elf-objcopy -O ihex hello_cpp.elf hello_cpp.hex
```

This script builds the bare-metal C++ application for RV64. After cleaning old files, it ensures the RISC-V cross-compiler toolchain (including `g++`) is in the PATH. The `riscv64-unknown-elf-g++` command compiles the C++ source (`hello_cpp.cpp`) and links it with the C++ standard library and runtime support to create the ELF executable (`hello_cpp.elf`). The `objcopy` command then converts this ELF file into Intel HEX format (`hello_cpp.hex`).

type:

```bash
export PATH=/opt/riscv-elf-gcc/bin:${PATH}

spike pk hello_cpp.elf
```

This command runs the compiled bare-metal C++ application (`hello_cpp.elf`) using the Spike simulator with the Proxy Kernel (`pk`). The Proxy Kernel intercepts system calls made by the C++ standard library (e.g., for console output via `std::cout`) and handles them, allowing the application to run correctly within the simulated environment. This demonstrates how C++ applications can be executed and tested on RISC-V using standard simulation tools before deploying to hardware.

##### Go Language

...

Go language support for RISC-V in a bare metal context allows developers to write efficient and scalable applications that run directly on RISC-V hardware without an operating system. Go's simplicity and strong support for concurrent programming make it well-suited for embedded systems development. Bare metal programming in Go on RISC-V enables the creation of robust and maintainable software, taking advantage of Go's modern syntax and extensive standard library.

Hello QueenField in Go Language:

```go
package main

import "fmt"
func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello QueenField!")
}
```

Running Go applications like this "Hello QueenField!" example in a pure bare-metal RISC-V environment (without an OS) typically requires a specialized compiler like TinyGo. TinyGo targets microcontrollers and provides a minimal runtime, making it suitable for resource-constrained systems. The `fmt.Println` function would rely on TinyGo's runtime support for the specific RISC-V target to direct output to a configured UART or simulator console. Using the standard Go compiler usually targets an OS environment like Linux.

type:

```bash
rm -rf hello_go.elf
rm -rf hello_go.hex

export PATH=/opt/riscv-elf-gcc/bin:${PATH}
export PATH=/opt/riscv-go/bin:${PATH}

GOOS=linux GOARCH=riscv64 go build -o hello_go.elf hello_go.go
riscv64-unknown-elf-objcopy -O ihex hello_go.elf hello_go.hex
```

This script demonstrates building a Go application, but it targets the Linux operating system on RISC-V 64-bit (`GOOS=linux GOARCH=riscv64`), not a bare-metal environment. It uses the standard Go compiler (`go build`) to create a Linux ELF executable (`hello_go.elf`). The subsequent `objcopy` command converts this Linux executable to HEX format. While this HEX file could potentially be loaded, running it would require a Linux environment (either on hardware or in a simulator like QEMU running Linux), not a bare-metal setup or Spike with pk. For true bare-metal Go, TinyGo would typically be used.

##### Rust Language

...

Rust language support for RISC-V in a bare metal environment brings the advantages of memory safety and concurrency to embedded programming. Rust's emphasis on preventing common programming errors, such as null pointer dereferencing and data races, makes it an ideal choice for developing reliable and secure applications. Writing bare metal applications in Rust on RISC-V ensures high performance and correctness, providing developers with confidence in the safety and efficiency of their code.

Hello QueenField in Rust Language:

```rust
fn main() {
  println!("Hello QueenField!");
}
```

Executing this Rust "Hello QueenField!" program on bare-metal RISC-V involves compiling with `rustc` targeting a specification like `riscv64imac-unknown-none-elf`. In this `#![no_std]` context, the `println!` macro needs an implementation. This is usually provided by including a HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) or BSP (Board Support Package) crate specific to the RISC-V target hardware or simulator. This crate implements the necessary low-level routines (e.g., UART writes) required for console output, leveraging Rust's ecosystem for embedded development.

#### RISC-V Operating System

The RISC-V architecture's open standard nature has encouraged broad operating system support. Major operating systems like GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, and others have established ports for RISC-V (both RV32 and RV64). Running a full OS enables complex applications by providing essential services like process management, virtual memory, file systems, networking, and standard APIs (POSIX). This allows developers to leverage the vast ecosystem of existing software and tools, making RISC-V suitable for a wide range of computing tasks, from embedded systems to servers.

##### GNU Linux

...

GNU Linux support for RISC-V provides a full-featured operating system environment, offering a rich set of tools and libraries for application development. This enables the development of complex and sophisticated applications on RISC-V processors, leveraging the extensive Linux ecosystem. Running GNU Linux on RISC-V facilitates the creation of networked, multitasking, and user-space applications, significantly expanding the range of potential use cases for RISC-V.

**Building BusyBox**

type:

```bash
export PATH=/opt/riscv-elf-gcc/bin:${PATH}

git clone --recursive https://git.busybox.net/busybox

cd busybox
make CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu- defconfig
make CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-
```

This sequence of commands downloads and builds BusyBox for a 64-bit RISC-V Linux target. BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small executable, providing a minimal yet functional userspace environment for embedded Linux systems. The `CROSS_COMPILE` variable tells the build system to use the specified RISC-V Linux cross-compiler toolchain (`riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-`). `make defconfig` creates a default configuration, and `make` builds the BusyBox executable according to that configuration.

**Building Linux**

type:

```bash
export PATH=/opt/riscv-elf-gcc/bin:${PATH}

git clone --recursive https://github.com/torvalds/linux

cd linux
make ARCH=riscv CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu- defconfig
make ARCH=riscv CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-
```

These commands download the Linux kernel source code and compile it for the 64-bit RISC-V architecture. The `ARCH=riscv` variable specifies the target architecture, and `CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-` indicates the cross-compiler toolchain to use. `make defconfig` selects a default kernel configuration suitable for RISC-V, and `make` builds the kernel image (typically `vmlinux` or `Image`) based on this configuration, ready to be booted on RISC-V hardware or a simulator.

**Running Linux**

type:

```bash
export PATH=/opt/riscv-elf-gcc/bin:${PATH}

qemu-system-riscv64 -nographic -machine virt \
-kernel Image -append "root=/dev/vda ro console=ttyS0" \
-drive file=busybox,format=raw,id=hd0 \
-device virtio-blk-device,drive=hd0
```

This command uses QEMU (`qemu-system-riscv64`) to emulate a 64-bit RISC-V virtual machine (`-machine virt`) and boot the compiled Linux kernel (`-kernel Image`). The `-nographic` option disables graphical output, directing console I/O to the terminal. The `-append` argument passes kernel boot parameters, specifying the root filesystem device (`/dev/vda`, read-only `ro`) and the console (`ttyS0`). The `-drive` option provides the root filesystem image (presumably the built `busybox` executable prepared as a raw disk image) as a virtual disk (`hd0`), which is attached to the virtual machine using a virtio block device (`-device virtio-blk-device`).

**Running Linux RISC-V 32 bit with Buildroot**

type:

```bash
export PATH=/opt/riscv-elf-gcc/bin:${PATH}

git clone --recursive https://github.com/buildroot/buildroot

cd buildroot
make qemu_riscv32_virt_defconfig
make

qemu-system-riscv32 \
-M virt \
-nographic \
-bios output/images/fw_jump.elf \
-kernel output/images/Image \
-append "root=/dev/vda ro" \
-drive file=output/images/rootfs.ext2,format=raw,id=hd0 \
-device virtio-blk-device,drive=hd0 \
-netdev user,id=net0 \
-device virtio-net-device,netdev=net0
```

This demonstrates using Buildroot to create and run a complete 32-bit RISC-V Linux system. Buildroot is a tool that simplifies and automates the process of building embedded Linux systems. After cloning Buildroot, `make qemu_riscv32_virt_defconfig` selects a pre-defined configuration for a 32-bit RISC-V virtual machine target suitable for QEMU. `make` then builds the entire system, including the toolchain, bootloader (`fw_jump.elf`), kernel (`Image`), and root filesystem (`rootfs.ext2`). The subsequent `qemu-system-riscv32` command boots this generated system in QEMU, specifying the machine type, disabling graphics, providing the bootloader, kernel, root filesystem image, and setting up basic block device and network interfaces.

**Running Linux RISC-V 64 bit with Buildroot**

type:

```bash
export PATH=/opt/riscv-elf-gcc/bin:${PATH}

git clone --recursive https://github.com/buildroot/buildroot

cd buildroot
make qemu_riscv64_virt_defconfig
make

qemu-system-riscv64 \
-M virt \
-nographic \
-bios output/images/fw_jump.elf \
-kernel output/images/Image \
-append "root=/dev/vda ro" \
-drive file=output/images/rootfs.ext2,format=raw,id=hd0 \
-device virtio-blk-device,drive=hd0 \
-netdev user,id=net0 \
-device virtio-net-device,netdev=net0
```

This example mirrors the previous one but targets the 64-bit RISC-V architecture. It uses Buildroot with the `qemu_riscv64_virt_defconfig` configuration to build a complete Linux system (bootloader, kernel, root filesystem) for RV64. The `qemu-system-riscv64` command then launches this system in the QEMU emulator, configured for a 64-bit virtual machine (`-M virt`) and providing the necessary components (BIOS, kernel, rootfs) generated by Buildroot, along with virtual block and network devices. This provides a convenient way to test and develop for 64-bit RISC-V Linux environments.

##### GNU Hurd

...

GNU Hurd support for RISC-V offers an alternative operating system environment based on the GNU Mach microkernel. Hurd provides a modular and flexible architecture, allowing fine-grained control over system resources. Running GNU Hurd on RISC-V enables developers to explore advanced system programming concepts and create highly customizable operating system components, opening new possibilities for innovative embedded applications on the RISC-V platform.

#### RISC-V Distribution

Full Linux distributions, traditionally found on desktops and servers, are increasingly available for RISC-V. Projects like Debian and Fedora offer official or community-supported ports for RISC-V (primarily RV64). These distributions provide a rich software ecosystem with thousands of pre-compiled packages, package management systems (APT, DNF), standard libraries, and development tools. Running a distribution simplifies development and deployment of complex applications on RISC-V hardware or simulators by providing a familiar and comprehensive software environment.

##### GNU Debian

...

GNU Debian distribution for RISC-V provides a comprehensive package management system, simplifying the installation, updating, and management of software on RISC-V devices. Debian's extensive repository of precompiled packages ensures that developers have access to a wide range of tools and libraries, enhancing productivity and simplifying development. The Debian distribution for RISC-V supports robust and scalable application development, leveraging the stability and reliability of the Debian ecosystem.

##### GNU Fedora

...

GNU Fedora distribution for RISC-V offers a cutting-edge platform with the latest software and technologies tailored for RISC-V processors. Fedora's emphasis on innovation and rapid updates ensures that developers have access to the newest features and improvements. Using the Fedora distribution on RISC-V, developers can build and deploy modern, high-performance applications, benefiting from the extensive community support and rich documentation provided by the Fedora project.

**Running Fedora**

type:

```bash
export PATH=/opt/riscv-elf-gcc/bin:${PATH}

qemu-system-riscv64 \
-nographic \
-machine virt \
-smp 4 \
-m 2G \
-kernel Fedora-RISCV.elf \
-bios none \
-object rng-random,filename=/dev/urandom,id=rng0 \
-device virtio-rng-device,rng=rng0 \
-device virtio-blk-device,drive=hd0 \
-drive file=Fedora-RISCV.raw,format=raw,id=hd0 \
-device virtio-net-device,netdev=usernet \
-netdev user,id=usernet,hostfwd=tcp::10000-:22
```

This command demonstrates running a pre-built Fedora RISC-V image using QEMU. It configures a 64-bit virtual machine (`-machine virt`) with 4 CPU cores (`-smp 4`) and 2GB of RAM (`-m 2G`). Instead of a separate BIOS and kernel, it uses a combined kernel/bootloader ELF file (`-kernel Fedora-RISCV.elf`) and specifies `-bios none`. It sets up a virtual random number generator (`-object rng-random`, `-device virtio-rng-device`) and attaches the Fedora raw disk image (`-drive file=Fedora-RISCV.raw`) using a virtio block device. Networking is enabled using QEMU's user-mode network stack (`-netdev user`), attached via a virtio network device, and includes port forwarding (`hostfwd`) to allow SSH access to the guest on port 10000.
