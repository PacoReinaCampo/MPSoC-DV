# EXPRESSION EVALUATION

## EXPRESSION EVALUATION RULES

The IEEE 754 standard defines rules for evaluating expressions to ensure consistent and accurate results. These rules include how intermediate results are handled, the precision of operations, and the order of operations.

Key Points

- **Intermediate Precision**: Intermediate results should be computed with sufficient precision to minimize rounding errors.
- **Order of Operations**: The order in which operations are performed should adhere to standard mathematical rules, with consideration for rounding and precision.
- **Associativity and Commutativity**: Floating-point arithmetic is not always associative or commutative due to rounding errors. The evaluation order can affect the final result.
- **Explicit Parentheses**: Use of parentheses to enforce specific evaluation order is encouraged to ensure clarity and correctness.
- **Rounding**: Each operation should be rounded according to the current rounding mode.

Example

For an expression like $ a + (b \times c) $, the multiplication is performed first, and its result is rounded before adding to $ a $.

## ASSIGNMENTS, PARAMETERS, AND FUNCTION VALUES
The handling of assignments, parameters, and function values in IEEE 754 is critical to maintaining precision and consistency throughout computations.

Assignments

- **Precision Preservation**: When assigning a value to a variable, the precision of the variable should match the precision of the expression's result.
- **Explicit Casting**: If a value is assigned to a variable of a different precision, explicit casting should be used to indicate the conversion and rounding that occur.

Parameters and Function Values

- **Passing by Value**: Function parameters should be passed by value, ensuring that the function receives the exact value intended, without unintended modifications.
- **Return Values**: Function return values should match the declared precision of the function, ensuring that results are correctly rounded and represented.

Example
```c
// Example in C-like pseudocode
double func(double x) {
    return x * x;
}

double result = func(1.234567);
```
Here, `x` is passed by value, and the result is returned as a double with appropriate precision.

## PREFERREDWIDTH ATTRIBUTES FOR EXPRESSION EVALUATION
The `preferredWidth` attribute allows specifying the preferred precision for evaluating expressions, which can be different from the storage precision of variables.

Usage

- **Extended Precision**: Use `preferredWidth` to evaluate expressions in higher precision to minimize rounding errors, even if the variables are stored in lower precision.
- **Control of Precision**: Provides a way to control the precision of intermediate results without changing the storage format.

Example
```c
// Example using pseudocode
preferredWidth = extended;

double a = 1.234567;
double b = 8.765432;
double result = (a + b) * (a - b); // evaluated with extended precision
```

In this example, the expression is evaluated with extended precision, reducing rounding errors, but the final result is stored in double precision.

## LITERAL MEANING AND VALUE-CHANGING OPTIMIZATIONS

The IEEE 754 standard addresses how literals are interpreted and how optimizations that change values should be handled.

Literal Meaning

- **Exact Representation**: Numeric literals should be represented as exactly as possible within the precision limits of the floating-point format.
- **Context-Sensitive**: The interpretation of literals may depend on the context in which they are used (e.g., default double precision).

Value-Changing Optimizations

- **Safety of Optimizations**: Optimizations that change the value of expressions should be carefully considered to avoid introducing significant errors.
- **Examples of Optimizations**:
  - **Constant Folding**: Simplifying expressions involving constants at compile time.
  - **Strength Reduction**: Replacing expensive operations with cheaper ones, e.g., replacing `x * 2.0` with `x + x`.

Guidelines

- **Preserve Semantics**: Optimizations should preserve the semantic meaning of the original expression as closely as possible.
- **Accuracy vs. Performance**: Balance the need for numerical accuracy with performance improvements when applying optimizations.

Example

```c
// Example in C-like pseudocode
double a = 1.0e10;
double b = 1.0e-10;
double result = a + b - a; // Optimizer should handle this carefully
```

Here, an optimizer might simplify the expression to `b`, but this must be done with consideration of the potential loss of precision.

In summary, IEEE 754 provides comprehensive guidelines for expression evaluation to ensure that floating-point computations are performed accurately and consistently. By adhering to these rules, handling assignments and function parameters correctly, leveraging `preferredWidth` attributes, and carefully applying value-changing optimizations, programmers can achieve reliable and precise floating-point arithmetic in their applications.
