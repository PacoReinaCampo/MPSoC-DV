# RECOMMENDED OPERATIONS

## CONFORMING LANGUAGE- AND IMPLEMENTATION-DEFINED OPERATIONS

These operations are those that a conforming implementation must support, but the exact behavior or specification might depend on the specific programming language or implementation. The IEEE 754 standard allows some latitude in how these operations are realized to accommodate different programming environments and hardware capabilities.

Examples:

- **Trigonometric functions** (sin, cos, tan, etc.)
- **Exponential and logarithmic functions** (exp, log, log10, etc.)
- **Hyperbolic functions** (sinh, cosh, tanh, etc.)

These functions should conform to the standard in terms of accuracy and exception handling, but the precise implementation details can vary.

## ADDITIONAL MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS

These operations extend the basic set of arithmetic operations to include more advanced mathematical functions. Implementations are encouraged to provide these for enhanced computational capabilities.

Examples:

- **Power function** (pow(x, y)): Computes $x^y$.
- **Root functions** (sqrt(x), cbrt(x)): Compute square root and cube root, respectively.
- **Exponential functions** (exp(x), expm1(x)): Compute $e^x$ and $e^x - 1$.
- **Logarithmic functions** (log(x), log1p(x)): Compute natural logarithm and $\ln(1 + x)$.
- **Trigonometric functions** (sin(x), cos(x), tan(x), etc.): Compute sine, cosine, tangent, and their inverses.
- **Hyperbolic functions** (sinh(x), cosh(x), tanh(x), etc.): Compute hyperbolic sine, cosine, tangent, and their inverses.

These operations are expected to handle special cases (e.g., NaNs, infinities) according to the standard's rules.

## DYNAMIC MODE OPERATIONS

Dynamic mode operations allow the modification of rounding modes and other floating-point environment settings at runtime. This capability is essential for applications requiring precise control over numerical behavior.

Examples:

- **Setting Rounding Mode**: Temporarily change the rounding mode (e.g., round to nearest, round toward zero, etc.).
- **Saving and Restoring Environment**: Save the current floating-point environment (including flags and modes) and restore it later.

Usage:

These operations enable fine-tuning of floating-point arithmetic for specific parts of a program, ensuring that calculations meet specific precision or performance requirements.

## REDUCTION OPERATIONS

Reduction operations are used to compute a single result from a set of values. They are fundamental in parallel computing and numerical analysis.

Examples

- **Sum**: Compute the sum of a sequence of numbers.
- **Product**: Compute the product of a sequence of numbers.
- **Dot Product**: Compute the dot product of two vectors.
- **Norm**: Compute the norm of a vector.

Usage:

Reduction operations are critical in applications such as machine learning, scientific computing, and graphics, where they help to consolidate large sets of data into meaningful results.

## AUGMENTED ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS

Augmented arithmetic operations provide extended precision and accuracy by combining multiple operations into a single step, minimizing intermediate rounding errors.

Examples

- **Fused Multiply-Add (FMA)**: Computes $ (x \times y) + z $ in a single step with only one rounding error, enhancing precision.

Usage:

These operations are particularly useful in numerical algorithms that require high precision, such as iterative solvers and simulations.

## MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM OPERATIONS

Minimum and maximum operations determine the smallest or largest value among a set of operands.

Examples:

- **Min(x, y)**: Returns the smaller of $x$ and $y$.
- **Max(x, y)**: Returns the larger of $x$ and $y$.

Special Cases:

- If either operand is NaN, these operations typically propagate NaN as the result, ensuring that the presence of an undefined value is not ignored.

Usage:
These operations are fundamental in algorithms that involve optimization, comparison, and selection tasks.

## NAN PAYLOAD OPERATIONS

NaN payload operations deal with the payload (additional information) stored in a NaN. This payload can be used to carry diagnostic information.

Examples

- **Get Payload**: Extract the payload from a NaN.
- **Set Payload**: Set the payload in a NaN.

Usage:

These operations are useful in debugging and diagnostics, allowing the program to store and retrieve additional information about the origin and nature of NaNs encountered during computation.

In summary, the recommended operations in the IEEE 754 standard extend the basic set of floating-point arithmetic operations to cover a wide range of mathematical, diagnostic, and control tasks. These operations enhance the flexibility, precision, and usability of floating-point arithmetic in diverse computational applications.

Expression evaluation in the IEEE 754 standard ensures that floating-point calculations are performed consistently and predictably. This section covers the rules and considerations for evaluating expressions, handling assignments and function parameters, managing precision, and optimizing computations.
