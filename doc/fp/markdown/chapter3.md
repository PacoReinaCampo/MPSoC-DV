# FLOATING-POINT FORMATS

## OVERVIEW

The IEEE 754 standard specifies formats for representing floating-point numbers, including both binary and decimal formats. These formats are designed to accommodate a wide range of values with sufficient precision and to handle special values like zero, infinity, and NaN. The standard defines:

- **Basic formats**: Standardized formats with fixed widths, such as single precision and double precision.
- **Extended formats**: Formats with greater precision or range, not strictly standardized in terms of width but adhering to certain rules.
- **Interchange formats**: Encodings that facilitate the exchange of floating-point data between different systems.

## SPECIFICATION LEVELS

The specification levels of floating-point formats in IEEE 754 include:

1. **Format**: The general structure of a floating-point representation, specifying the division into sign, exponent, and significand (fraction) fields.
2. **Encoding**: The specific bit-level layout of the floating-point format.
3. **Representation**: The interpretation of the encoded bits as a numerical value.

## SETS OF FLOATING-POINT DATA

IEEE 754 defines several sets of floating-point data:

1. **Finite numbers**: Represented by sign, exponent, and significand fields, covering a wide range of values.
2. **Zero**: Special cases for +0 and -0, representing positive and negative zero.
3. **Infinity**: Special values for +∞ and -∞, representing overflow or division by zero.
4. **NaN (Not-a-Number)**: Used to represent undefined or unrepresentable values. There are two types:
   - **Quiet NaNs (qNaN)**: Propagate through most operations without signaling exceptions.
   - **Signaling NaNs (sNaN)**: Used to signal exceptions when encountered.

## BINARY INTERCHANGE FORMAT ENCODINGS

Binary interchange formats are the most commonly used floating-point formats and include:

1. **Single Precision (32-bit)**:
   - 1 bit for the sign.
   - 8 bits for the exponent (with a bias of 127).
   - 23 bits for the significand (fraction).
2. **Double Precision (64-bit)**:
   - 1 bit for the sign.
   - 11 bits for the exponent (with a bias of 1023).
   - 52 bits for the significand (fraction).
3. **Quadruple Precision (128-bit)**:
   - 1 bit for the sign.
   - 15 bits for the exponent (with a bias of 16383).
   - 112 bits for the significand (fraction).

These formats ensure a wide range of values and high precision. They follow a similar structure but differ in the number of bits allocated to the exponent and significand.

## DECIMAL INTERCHANGE FORMAT ENCODINGS

Decimal interchange formats are used in applications where decimal precision is critical, such as financial calculations. These formats include:

1. **Decimal32 (32-bit)**:
   - 1 bit for the sign.
   - 7 bits for the exponent.
   - 24 bits for the significand.
2. **Decimal64 (64-bit)**:
   - 1 bit for the sign.
   - 10 bits for the exponent.
   - 53 bits for the significand.
3. **Decimal128 (128-bit)**:
   - 1 bit for the sign.
   - 14 bits for the exponent.
   - 113 bits for the significand.

Decimal interchange formats can represent decimal numbers exactly, which is essential for avoiding rounding errors in critical applications.

## INTERCHANGE FORMAT PARAMETERS

The parameters for interchange formats include:

- **Precision**: Number of significant digits that can be represented.
- **Exponent range**: The range of exponents that can be represented, determined by the number of bits in the exponent field and the bias.
- **Bias**: A constant added to the actual exponent to get a non-negative exponent value that can be stored in the exponent field.
- **Encoding rules**: Specific rules for encoding finite numbers, zero, infinity, and NaN.

## EXTENDED AND EXTENDABLE PRECISIONS

1. **Extended Precision**:
   - Formats with greater precision or range than the basic formats.
   - Commonly used in intermediate calculations to reduce rounding errors.
   - Example: Extended double precision with a larger exponent and significand field than the standard double precision.

2. **Extendable Precisions**:
   - User-defined formats that adhere to the IEEE 754 rules but are not fixed in size.
   - Provide flexibility for specific applications requiring higher precision or range than standard formats.
   - Must define the structure and encoding rules, ensuring compatibility with IEEE 754 operations and exceptions.

These formats are essential for scientific computations, simulations, and other applications requiring high precision and large dynamic ranges.

By defining these formats and their encoding, the IEEE 754 standard ensures that floating-point arithmetic is consistent, reliable, and portable across different computing systems and applications.

The IEEE 754 standard specifies various attributes and rounding rules that govern floating-point arithmetic. These attributes and rounding directions are essential for ensuring consistent and predictable results across different computing systems. Here's a detailed explanation:
