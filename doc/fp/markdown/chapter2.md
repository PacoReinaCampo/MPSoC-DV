# DEFINITIONS, ABBREVIATIONS, AND ACRONYMS

## DEFINITIONS

1. **Floating-Point Number**: A numerical value represented in a way that can support a wide range of values by using a fraction (mantissa), an exponent, and a base (typically 2 for binary representation).

2. **Sign Bit**: The bit in a floating-point number that indicates its sign. A sign bit of 0 typically means the number is positive, while a sign bit of 1 means the number is negative.

3. **Exponent**: Part of a floating-point number that scales the significand (fraction) by a power of the base (usually 2 for binary floating-point numbers). It is biased to allow for both positive and negative exponents.

4. **Significand (or Mantissa)**: The part of a floating-point number that contains its significant digits. In normalized form, the significand is adjusted to fall within a certain range (typically 1 ≤ significand < 2 for binary).

5. **Normalized Number**: A floating-point number where the significand is adjusted such that its leading digit is non-zero. This maximizes the precision of the number.

6. **Subnormal Number (or Denormalized Number)**: A floating-point number where the exponent is at its minimum value and the significand does not follow the normalization rule. These numbers allow for representation of values closer to zero than normalized numbers.

7. **NaN (Not-a-Number)**: A special value representing an undefined or unrepresentable value, such as the result of 0/0 or the square root of a negative number.

8. **Infinity (∞)**: Represents values that are beyond the largest representable finite number. Positive infinity and negative infinity are used to indicate overflow in floating-point calculations.

9. **Rounding**: The process of adjusting the result of a floating-point operation to fit within the available precision. IEEE 754 defines several rounding modes, including round to nearest, round toward zero, round toward positive infinity, and round toward negative infinity.

10. **Exception**: An event that occurs during a floating-point operation that requires special handling, such as overflow, underflow, division by zero, or invalid operations.

11. **Bias**: A constant added to the exponent of a floating-point number to get a non-negative value that can be stored in the exponent field. For example, the bias for single-precision floating-point numbers is 127.

12. **Precision**: The number of significant digits that can be represented in a floating-point number. It includes the digits in the significand and depends on the format (e.g., single, double, extended).

Understanding these definitions, abbreviations, and acronyms is crucial for working with the IEEE 754 standard, as they provide the foundation for consistent and accurate floating-point arithmetic in computing environments.

The IEEE 754 standard defines several floating-point formats to ensure consistency and portability of floating-point arithmetic across different computing platforms. These formats specify how floating-point numbers are represented, encoded, and processed.
