# UBus Specification

## Introduction
The UBus Specification provides a detailed description of the UBus, a bus protocol designed for communication between components within a digital system.

### Motivation
The motivation behind the UBus protocol is to establish a standardized and efficient means of data transfer and control signals between various components in a digital system.

### Bus Overview
The UBus facilitates communication between components such as processors, memory modules, and peripheral devices by defining a set of signals and protocols for data exchange.

## Bus Description
The UBus protocol defines the behavior of various bus signals, clocking mechanisms, and reset procedures to ensure reliable and efficient communication.

### Bus Signals
The UBus specification outlines the different signals used for communication, including data lines, address lines, control signals, and clock signals.

### Clocking
Clocking mechanisms in the UBus regulate the timing of bus transactions and ensure synchronous operation between transmitting and receiving components.

### Reset
The reset procedure in the UBus protocol initializes the bus and associated components to a known state, ensuring proper functionality during system startup or recovery.

## Arbitration Phase
During the arbitration phase, multiple bus masters compete for control of the bus to initiate transactions. The UBus specification defines the arbitration mechanism to resolve conflicts and determine the bus master.

## Address Phase
The address phase of the UBus protocol involves transmitting address information to select a specific target device or register for data transfer.

### NOP Cycle
In the NOP cycle, no actual data transfer occurs, allowing bus masters to relinquish control of the bus without performing a transaction.

### Normal Address Phase
During the normal address phase, bus masters transmit address information to specify the target device or register for subsequent data transfer operations.

## Data Phase
The data phase of the UBus protocol involves the actual transfer of data between bus masters and target devices.

### Write Transfer
In a write transfer, bus masters transmit data to target devices for storage or processing, following the address phase.

### Error during Write Transfer
The UBus specification defines error-handling mechanisms for detecting and handling errors that may occur during write transfers.

### Read Transfer
In a read transfer, target devices transmit data to bus masters in response to read requests, following the address phase.

### Error during Read Transfer
Error-handling mechanisms in the UBus protocol address potential errors that may occur during read transfers, ensuring data integrity and reliability.

## How Data is Driven
The UBus specification outlines the mechanisms for driving data on the bus, including data setup and hold times, to ensure proper data capture by receiving devices.

## Optional Pipelining Scheme
The UBus protocol optionally supports a pipelining scheme to improve bus efficiency and throughput by overlapping different phases of bus transactions.

### Pipelined Arbitration Phase
Pipelined arbitration allows bus masters to initiate arbitration for subsequent transactions while ongoing transactions are in progress, reducing latency and maximizing bus utilization.

### Pipelined Address Phase
Pipelined address phase enables bus masters to transmit address information for upcoming transactions while ongoing transactions are still in progress, further reducing latency and improving throughput.

### Pipelined Data Phase
Pipelined data phase allows for the concurrent transmission of data for multiple transactions, overlapping with arbitration and address phases, to maximize bus efficiency.

## Example Timing Diagrams
The UBus specification provides example timing diagrams to illustrate the timing relationships between different bus signals and phases during typical bus transactions, aiding in understanding and implementation.
