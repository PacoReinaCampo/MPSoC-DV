# UBus Verification Component Example

## UBus Example
The UBus Verification Component Example demonstrates the verification of a UBus, a fictional bus protocol, using the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM).

## UBus Example Architecture
The architecture of the UBus Example comprises various components such as the UBus top module, test, testbench environment, UBus environment, UBus master agent, UBus master sequencer, UBus driver, UBus agent monitor, UBus bus monitor, and UBus interface.

## UBus Top Module
The UBus top module represents the top-level module of the UBus design, which includes the interface to the UBus and connects to the DUT (Design Under Test).

## The Test
The test specifies the scenarios and test cases to be executed to verify the functionality of the UBus protocol.

## Testbench Environment
The testbench environment provides the infrastructure for verifying the UBus design, including instantiation and configuration of verification components.

## UBus Environment
The UBus environment encapsulates the UBus verification components and configurations required for verification.

## UBus Master Agent
The UBus master agent acts as the interface between the testbench and the UBus, generating and driving transactions on the UBus.

## UBus Master Sequencer
The UBus master sequencer controls the generation and sequencing of transactions sent by the UBus master agent, ensuring proper synchronization and timing.

## UBus Driver
The UBus driver transmits stimulus or transactions to the UBus based on sequences generated by the UBus master sequencer.

## UBus Agent Monitor
The UBus agent monitor observes and captures transactions or signals exchanged between the testbench and the UBus, facilitating analysis and verification.

## UBus Bus Monitor
The UBus bus monitor monitors transactions on the UBus, collecting data for analysis and coverage tracking.

### Collecting Transfers from the Bus
The UBus bus monitor collects transfers from the bus, including read and write operations, to analyze the behavior of the UBus.

### Number of Transfers
The UBus bus monitor tracks the number of transfers on the bus, ensuring adequate stimulus coverage during verification.

### Notifiers Emitted by the UBus Bus Monitor
The UBus bus monitor emits notifiers to notify other verification components of specific events or conditions observed on the bus.

### Checks and Coverage
The UBus bus monitor performs checks and coverage tracking to ensure the correctness and completeness of the UBus verification.

## UBus Interface
The UBus interface defines the communication interface between the UBus and the DUT, facilitating data transfer and control signals between the two entities.
