# Using Verification Components

## Creating a Top-Level Environment
A top-level environment orchestrates the verification process by instantiating and configuring verification components.

## Instantiating Verification Components
Verification components, such as agents, drivers, sequencers, monitors, and scoreboards, are instantiated within the top-level environment to create a comprehensive verification environment.

## Creating Test Classes
Test classes define specific test scenarios or use cases to verify the functionality of the design under test (DUT).

## Verification Component Configuration
Verification components can be configured with specific parameters and settings to tailor their behavior according to the verification requirements.

### Verification Component Configurable Parameters
Configurable parameters define the characteristics and behavior of verification components, allowing customization based on test scenarios.

### Verification Component Configuration Mechanism
The configuration mechanism provides a means to set and modify configurable parameters of verification components dynamically during runtime.

### Choosing between uvm_resource_db and uvm_config_db
The choice between uvm_resource_db and uvm_config_db depends on the specific requirements and preferences of the verification environment.

### Using a Configuration Class
A configuration class encapsulates configurable parameters and settings, promoting modularity and reusability in verification environments.

## Creating and Selecting a User-Defined Test
User-defined tests are created to verify specific aspects of the DUT's functionality and behavior.

### Creating the Base Test
The base test class serves as a foundation for creating test scenarios, defining common functionality shared among different test cases.

### Creating Tests from a Test-Family Base Class
Tests can be derived from a test-family base class, allowing for the creation of multiple test cases with shared functionalities and configurations.

### Test Selection
Test selection mechanisms determine which test cases to execute based on the verification objectives and requirements.

## Creating Meaningful Tests
Meaningful tests focus on verifying critical functionalities and scenarios of the DUT by constraining data items and defining test-specific frames.

### Constraining Data Items
Constraining data items ensures that test scenarios cover relevant and meaningful aspects of the DUT's behavior.

### Data Item Definitions
Data item definitions specify the structure and characteristics of stimuli or transactions applied to the DUT during verification.

### Creating a Test-Specific Frame
Test-specific frames encapsulate test scenarios and configurations, facilitating the execution of targeted verification tests.

## Virtual Sequences
Virtual sequences enable the creation and execution of complex test scenarios by controlling multiple sequencers and coordinating their activities.

### Creating a Virtual Sequencer
Virtual sequencers manage the execution of virtual sequences and coordinate interactions between different sequencers within the verification environment.

### Creating a Virtual Sequence
Virtual sequences define complex test scenarios and sequences of transactions to verify specific functionalities or scenarios of the DUT.

### Controlling Other Sequencers
Virtual sequences control the behavior of other sequencers by orchestrating their activities and synchronizing their operations.

### Connecting a Virtual Sequencer to Subsequencers
Virtual sequencers establish connections with sub-sequencers to delegate tasks and coordinate their activities within the verification environment.

## Checking for DUT Correctness
Verification environments include mechanisms to check the correctness of the DUT's behavior by comparing expected results with actual results.

## Scoreboards
Scoreboards analyze and evaluate the correctness of DUT outputs by comparing them with expected outputs and generating reports.

### Creating the Scoreboard
The scoreboard component is responsible for tracking and analyzing DUT outputs and verifying their correctness.

### Adding Exports to uvm_scoreboard
Exports in uvm_scoreboard facilitate communication with other verification components, enabling data exchange and result analysis.

### Requirements of the TLM Implementation
The Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM) implementation of the scoreboard ensures compatibility and interoperability with other TLM-based verification components.

### Defining the Action Taken
The scoreboard defines actions to be taken upon detecting discrepancies between expected and actual results, such as reporting errors or triggering alerts.

### Adding the Scoreboard to the Environment
Integrating the scoreboard into the verification environment enables comprehensive result analysis and verification coverage.

### Summary
Scoreboards summarize verification results and provide insights into the correctness and completeness of the DUT's functionality.

## Implementing a Coverage Model
Coverage models track the verification progress and measure the completeness of verification scenarios.

### Selecting a Coverage Method
The selection of a coverage method depends on the verification objectives and the desired level of coverage granularity.

### Implementing a Functional Coverage Model
Functional coverage models capture the functional aspects and behaviors of the DUT, ensuring comprehensive verification coverage.

### Enabling and Disabling Coverage
Coverage models can be enabled or disabled dynamically during runtime to focus on specific verification objectives or scenarios.
