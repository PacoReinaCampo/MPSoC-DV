2. **Availability**: Making the quality policy available to relevant interested parties as appropriate.
3. **Review and Update**: Regularly reviewing and updating the quality policy to reflect any changes in the organization or its context.

## ORGANIZATIONAL ROLES, RESPONSIBILITIES AND AUTHORITIES

Top management must ensure that roles, responsibilities, and authorities related to the QMS are clearly defined, communicated, and understood within the organization. This involves:

1. **Assignment of Responsibilities and Authorities**:

   - **Top Management**: Retaining overall responsibility for the QMS and its performance.

By defining and communicating organizational roles, responsibilities, and authorities, top management ensures that all employees understand their contributions to the QMS, facilitating effective implementation and ongoing improvement.

In summary, the **Leadership** section of ISO 9001:2015 emphasizes the pivotal role of top management in fostering a quality-oriented culture, establishing clear policies and objectives, and ensuring that all members of the organization understand their roles in maintaining and improving the QMS. This commitment and clarity drive the successful implementation and continual enhancement of quality management practices.
