### Customer Focus

Top management must demonstrate a strong commitment to understanding and meeting customer needs and enhancing customer satisfaction. This involves:

2. **Commitment to Requirements and Improvement**: Including a commitment to satisfy applicable requirements and to continual improvement of the QMS.
3. **Framework for Objectives**: Providing a framework for setting quality objectives.

### Communicating the Quality Policy

2. **Availability**: Making the quality policy available to relevant interested parties as appropriate.
3. **Review and Update**: Regularly reviewing and updating the quality policy to reflect any changes in the organization or its context.

## ORGANIZATIONAL ROLES, RESPONSIBILITIES AND AUTHORITIES

Top management must ensure that roles, responsibilities, and authorities related to the QMS are clearly defined, communicated, and understood within the organization. This involves:

1. **Assignment of Responsibilities and Authorities**:

   * **Top Management**: Retaining overall responsibility for the QMS and its performance.
   * **QMS Roles**: Assigning specific roles to individuals or teams for overseeing quality management activities.
   * **Communication and Understanding**: Ensuring that these roles are understood and communicated throughout the organization.

By defining and communicating organizational roles, responsibilities, and authorities, top management ensures that all employees understand their contributions to the QMS, facilitating effective implementation and ongoing improvement.

In summary, the **Leadership** section of ISO 9001:2015 emphasizes the pivotal role of top management in fostering a quality-oriented culture, establishing clear policies and objectives, and ensuring that all members of the organization understand their roles in maintaining and improving the QMS. This commitment and clarity drive the successful implementation and continual enhancement of quality management practices.
