# OPERATION

The **Operation** section of ISO 9001:2015 outlines the requirements for effectively planning, controlling, and executing various operational processes within an organization to ensure the consistent provision of products and services that meet customer requirements. This section covers operational planning and control, requirements for products and services, design and development, control of externally provided processes, production and service provision, release of products and services, and control of nonconforming outputs.

## OPERATIONAL PLANNING AND CONTROL

**Operational planning and control** involve defining processes and procedures to ensure that products and services are delivered in accordance with customer requirements and applicable standards. This includes:

   * Establishing processes and procedures for the effective execution of operations.
   * Determining resource requirements, including personnel, infrastructure, and materials.
   * Planning and scheduling activities to meet customer demands and deadlines.
   * Implementing controls to ensure that operations are carried out effectively and efficiently.

## REQUIREMENTS FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

Inputs to the design and development process include:

   * Customer requirements and specifications.
   * Legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements.
   * Lessons learned from previous design and development projects.

### Design and Development Controls

Controls must be implemented to ensure that design and development activities are carried out effectively and produce the desired outcomes. This includes:

   * Reviews and approvals at key stages of the design and development process.
   * Verification and validation activities to ensure that designs meet requirements.
   * Configuration management to control changes to design documents and specifications.

### Design and Development Outputs

The outputs of the design and development process include:

   * Detailed design specifications, drawings, and documentation.
   * Prototypes or samples for testing and validation.
   * Plans for production, testing, and implementation.

## CONTROL OF EXTERNALLY PROVIDED PROCESSES, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES

### General

The organization must ensure that externally provided processes, products, and services meet specified requirements. This includes:

   * Establishing criteria for selecting external providers.
   * Evaluating the competence and capability of external providers.
   * Monitoring and controlling externally provided processes, products, and services.

### Type and Extent of Control

The organization must determine the type and extent of control needed for externally provided processes, products, and services based on their importance to product conformity and customer satisfaction.

### Information for External Providers

The organization must communicate its requirements to external providers, including specifications, delivery schedules, and quality standards. This ensures that external providers understand and can meet the organization's expectations.

## PRODUCTION AND SERVICE PROVISION

### Control of Production and Service Provision

The organization must establish controls to ensure that production and service provision processes are carried out effectively and consistently. This includes:

   * Implementing documented procedures for production and service provision.
   * Monitoring and controlling process parameters to ensure product and service quality.
   * Conducting inspections and tests to verify product and service conformity.

### Identification and Traceability

The organization must establish procedures for identifying and tracing products and services throughout the production and service provision process. This includes:

   * Assigning unique identifiers to products and services.
   * Maintaining records of product and service status and location.

### Property Belonging to Customers or External Providers

The organization must identify, verify, protect, and safeguard property belonging to customers or external providers. This includes:

### Post-Delivery Activities

The organization must define processes for handling post-delivery activities, such as installation, operation, maintenance, and disposal of products and services. This ensures that products and services continue to meet customer requirements throughout their lifecycle.

### Control of Changes

The organization must establish procedures for controlling changes to production processes, products, and services. This includes:

   * Assessing the impact of proposed changes on product conformity and customer requirements.
   * Obtaining authorization before implementing changes.

## RELEASE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

The organization must establish procedures for the release of products and services to ensure that they meet specified requirements before delivery to customers. This includes:

   * Conducting final inspections and tests to verify product and service conformity.
