# OPERATION

The **Operation** section of ISO 9001:2015 outlines the requirements for effectively planning, controlling, and executing various operational processes within an organization to ensure the consistent provision of products and services that meet customer requirements. This section covers operational planning and control, requirements for products and services, design and development, control of externally provided processes, production and service provision, release of products and services, and control of nonconforming outputs.

## Operational Planning and Control

**Operational planning and control** involve defining processes and procedures to ensure that products and services are delivered in accordance with customer requirements and applicable standards. This includes:

- Establishing processes and procedures for the effective execution of operations.
- Determining resource requirements, including personnel, infrastructure, and materials.
- Planning and scheduling activities to meet customer demands and deadlines.
- Implementing controls to ensure that operations are carried out effectively and efficiently.

## Requirements for Products and Services

### Customer Communication

The organization must communicate with customers to understand their requirements, preferences, and any specific needs. This includes:

- Establishing effective channels for communication with customers.
- Gathering and documenting customer requirements.
- Clarifying any ambiguities or uncertainties in customer requirements.

### Determining the Requirements for Products and Services

The organization must determine the requirements for products and services before acceptance. This involves:

- Reviewing customer requirements, including specifications, drawings, and contracts.
- Identifying any legal, regulatory, or contractual requirements.
- Ensuring that the organization can meet the identified requirements.

### Review of the Requirements for Products and Services

Before accepting customer orders or contracts, the organization must review the requirements to ensure they are adequately defined and understood. This review verifies that the organization has the capability to meet the requirements and identifies any potential issues or risks.

### Changes to Requirements for Products and Services

The organization must review and agree on any changes to customer requirements, including changes to specifications, schedules, or delivery requirements. This ensures that the organization can accommodate changes without compromising quality or delivery deadlines.

## Design and Development of Products and Services

### General

Design and development processes ensure that products and services meet customer requirements and are fit for their intended purpose. This includes:

- Establishing procedures for designing and developing products and services.
- Ensuring that design and development activities are conducted by qualified personnel.
- Documenting design and development processes and outcomes.

### Design and Development Planning

The organization must plan the design and development process, including:

- Defining design and development objectives and criteria for success.
- Identifying resources needed for design and development activities.
- Establishing timelines and milestones for design and development projects.

### Design and Development Inputs

Inputs to the design and development process include:

- Customer requirements and specifications.
- Legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements.
- Lessons learned from previous design and development projects.

### Design and Development Controls

Controls must be implemented to ensure that design and development activities are carried out effectively and produce the desired outcomes. This includes:

- Reviews and approvals at key stages of the design and development process.
- Verification and validation activities to ensure that designs meet requirements.
- Configuration management to control changes to design documents and specifications.

### Design and Development Outputs

The outputs of the design and development process include:

- Detailed design specifications, drawings, and documentation.
- Prototypes or samples for testing and validation.
- Plans for production, testing, and implementation.

## Control of Externally Provided Processes, Products, and Services

### General

The organization must ensure that externally provided processes, products, and services meet specified requirements. This includes:

- Establishing criteria for selecting external providers.
- Evaluating the competence and capability of external providers.
- Monitoring and controlling externally provided processes, products, and services.

### Type and Extent of Control

The organization must determine the type and extent of control needed for externally provided processes, products, and services based on their importance to product conformity and customer satisfaction.

### Information for External Providers

The organization must communicate its requirements to external providers, including specifications, delivery schedules, and quality standards. This ensures that external providers understand and can meet the organization's expectations.

## Production and Service Provision

### Control of Production and Service Provision

The organization must establish controls to ensure that production and service provision processes are carried out effectively and consistently. This includes:

- Implementing documented procedures for production and service provision.
- Monitoring and controlling process parameters to ensure product and service quality.
- Conducting inspections and tests to verify product and service conformity.

### Identification and Traceability

The organization must establish procedures for identifying and tracing products and services throughout the production and service provision process. This includes:

- Assigning unique identifiers to products and services.
- Maintaining records of product and service status and location.

### Property Belonging to Customers or External Providers

The organization must identify, verify, protect, and safeguard property belonging to customers or external providers. This includes:

- Establishing procedures for handling and storing customer-supplied materials or equipment.
- Ensuring that customer property is not lost, damaged, or used improperly.

### Preservation

The organization must establish procedures for preserving the conformity of products and services during production and service provision. This includes:

- Implementing measures to prevent contamination, damage, or deterioration.
- Storing products and materials in appropriate conditions.

### Post-Delivery Activities

The organization must define processes for handling post-delivery activities, such as installation, operation, maintenance, and disposal of products and services. This ensures that products and services continue to meet customer requirements throughout their lifecycle.

### Control of Changes

The organization must establish procedures for controlling changes to production processes, products, and services. This includes:

- Assessing the impact of proposed changes on product conformity and customer requirements.
- Obtaining authorization before implementing changes.

## Release of Products and Services

The organization must establish procedures for the release of products and services to ensure that they meet specified requirements before delivery to customers. This includes:

- Conducting final inspections and tests to verify product and service conformity.
- Obtaining customer approval or acceptance before delivering products and services.

## Control of Nonconforming Outputs

The organization must establish procedures for identifying, segregating, and controlling nonconforming products and services to prevent their unintended use or delivery. This includes:

- Documenting nonconformities and initiating corrective actions to address root causes.
- Obtaining authorization before reworking or disposing of nonconforming products and services.

In summary, the **Operation** section of ISO 9001:2015 outlines requirements for effectively planning, controlling, and executing operational processes to ensure that products and services meet customer requirements and are delivered consistently with high quality. This includes defining requirements, designing and developing products and services, controlling externally provided processes, production and service provision, release of products and services, and control of nonconforming outputs. These requirements help organizations establish robust processes for delivering products and services that consistently meet customer expectations.
