# SUPPORT

The **Support** section of ISO 9001:2015 focuses on the resources, competence, awareness, communication, and documented information necessary to implement and maintain an effective Quality Management System (QMS). This section ensures that all the necessary support mechanisms are in place to achieve the intended outcomes of the QMS.

## Resources

### General

An organization must determine and provide the resources needed for the establishment, implementation, maintenance, and continual improvement of the QMS. This includes considering the capabilities and constraints on existing internal resources, as well as what needs to be obtained from external providers.

### People

The organization must ensure it has sufficient personnel with the necessary competencies to effectively implement the QMS, operate processes, and achieve conformity of products and services. This involves:

- Identifying human resource needs.
- Providing necessary training and development.
- Ensuring staff have the appropriate skills and qualifications.

### Infrastructure

Infrastructure refers to the facilities, equipment, and support services necessary for the operation of processes and to achieve conformity of products and services. This includes:

- Buildings and workspace.
- Utilities such as electricity and water.
- Equipment such as machinery and tools.
- Information and communication technology.

### Environment for the Operation of Processes

The organization must provide and manage the environment necessary for the operation of its processes. This includes both physical and non-physical factors, such as:

- Physical factors: Cleanliness, temperature, humidity, lighting, and noise.
- Non-physical factors: Workplace culture, morale, and well-being.

### Monitoring and Measuring Resources

#### General

The organization must determine and provide the necessary resources to ensure valid and reliable monitoring and measurement results. This includes:

- Identifying what needs to be measured and monitored.
- Ensuring measurement devices are suitable and properly maintained.
- Establishing processes for calibration and verification of measurement devices.

#### Measurement Traceability

Where traceability is a requirement, measurement instruments must be calibrated or verified at specified intervals against standards traceable to international or national measurement standards. If no such standards exist, the basis used for calibration or verification must be recorded. This ensures accuracy and reliability of measurements critical to the QMS.

### Organizational Knowledge

Organizational knowledge is the information necessary for the operation of processes and to achieve conformity of products and services. This includes:

- Capturing and sharing knowledge gained from experience.
- Learning from lessons learned, both successes and failures.
- Ensuring the availability of this knowledge to those who need it.

## Competence

The organization must ensure that employees performing work affecting the quality of products and services are competent based on appropriate education, training, skills, and experience. This involves:

- Determining the necessary competence for personnel performing work.
- Providing training or taking other actions to achieve the necessary competence.
- Evaluating the effectiveness of these actions.
- Retaining documented information as evidence of competence.

## Awareness

Employees must be aware of:

- The quality policy.
- Relevant quality objectives.
- Their contribution to the effectiveness of the QMS, including the benefits of improved performance.
- The implications of not conforming to QMS requirements.

## Communication

The organization must determine the internal and external communications relevant to the QMS, including:

- What needs to be communicated.
- When to communicate.
- With whom to communicate.
- How to communicate.

## Documented Information

### General

Documented information required by the QMS and by ISO 9001:2015 must be controlled to ensure it is available and suitable for use where and when it is needed. This includes:

- Creating, updating, and maintaining documents and records.

### Creating and Updating

When creating and updating documented information, the organization must ensure appropriate:

- Identification and description (e.g., title, date, author).
- Format (e.g., language, software version) and media (e.g., paper, electronic).
- Review and approval for suitability and adequacy.

### Control of Documented Information

Documented information must be controlled to ensure it is:

- Available and suitable for use.
- Adequately protected (e.g., from loss of confidentiality, improper use, or loss of integrity).

Control mechanisms must include:

- Distribution, access, retrieval, and use.
- Storage and preservation, including preservation of legibility.
- Control of changes, ensuring that revisions are identified and traceable.
- Retention and disposition, including disposal of obsolete information.

In summary, the **Support** section of ISO 9001:2015 ensures that the necessary resources, competencies, awareness, communication, and documented information are in place and effectively managed. This foundation is critical for the successful implementation, maintenance, and continual improvement of the QMS, ensuring it meets organizational and customer requirements.
