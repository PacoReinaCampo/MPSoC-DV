# TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

In the context of ISO 9001:2015, the section on **Terms and Definitions** is crucial for ensuring a clear and consistent understanding of the terminology used throughout the standard. This section typically references ISO 9000:2015, which provides detailed definitions and explanations of the key concepts and terms relevant to quality management systems (QMS).

## Importance of Terms and Definitions

1. **Consistency**:
   - Standardized terms ensure that everyone involved in implementing, auditing, and certifying a QMS has a consistent understanding of the key concepts and requirements.

2. **Clarity**:
   - Clear definitions help avoid misunderstandings and ambiguities, ensuring that all parties interpret the requirements of the standard in the same way.

3. **Foundation for Implementation**:
   - Understanding the specific terms used in the standard is essential for correctly applying the requirements and principles of ISO 9001:2015 within an organization.
