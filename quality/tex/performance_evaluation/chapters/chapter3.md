# MANAGEMENT REVIEW

## GENERAL

Top management must review the organizationâ€™s QMS at planned intervals to ensure its continuing suitability, adequacy, effectiveness, and alignment with the strategic direction of the organization. Management reviews should be conducted regularly and documented.

## MANAGEMENT REVIEW INPUTS

Inputs to the management review must include:

1. **Status of actions from previous management reviews**.
2. **Changes in external and internal issues relevant to the QMS**.
3. **Information on QMS performance and effectiveness**, including:
   - Trends in customer satisfaction and feedback.
   - Extent of quality objectives achieved.
   - Process performance and product conformity.
   - Nonconformities and corrective actions.
   - Audit results.
   - Performance of external providers.

4. **Adequacy of resources**.
5. **Effectiveness of actions taken to address risks and opportunities**.
6. **Opportunities for improvement**.

## MANAGEMENT REVIEW OUTPUTS

Outputs of the management review must include decisions and actions related to:

1. **Opportunities for improvement**.
2. **Any need for changes to the QMS**.
3. **Resource needs**.

Documented information must be retained as evidence of the results of management reviews, including any decisions and actions taken.

In summary, the **Performance Evaluation** section of ISO 9001:2015 ensures that an organization systematically monitors, measures, analyzes, and evaluates its QMS. Through customer satisfaction analysis, internal audits, and management reviews, the organization can identify areas for improvement, ensure compliance with requirements, and make informed decisions to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of its QMS.
