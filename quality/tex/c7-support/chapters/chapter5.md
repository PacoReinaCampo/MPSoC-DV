# DOCUMENTED INFORMATION

## GENERAL

Documented information required by the QMS and by ISO 9001:2015 must be controlled to ensure it is available and suitable for use where and when it is needed. This includes:

- Creating, updating, and maintaining documents and records.

## CREATING AND UPDATING

When creating and updating documented information, the organization must ensure appropriate:

- Identification and description (e.g., title, date, author).
- Format (e.g., language, software version) and media (e.g., paper, electronic).
- Review and approval for suitability and adequacy.

## CONTROL OF DOCUMENTED INFORMATION

Documented information must be controlled to ensure it is:

- Available and suitable for use.
- Adequately protected (e.g., from loss of confidentiality, improper use, or loss of integrity).

Control mechanisms must include:

- Distribution, access, retrieval, and use.
- Storage and preservation, including preservation of legibility.
- Control of changes, ensuring that revisions are identified and traceable.
- Retention and disposition, including disposal of obsolete information.

In summary, the **Support** section of ISO 9001:2015 ensures that the necessary resources, competencies, awareness, communication, and documented information are in place and effectively managed. This foundation is critical for the successful implementation, maintenance, and continual improvement of the QMS, ensuring it meets organizational and customer requirements.
