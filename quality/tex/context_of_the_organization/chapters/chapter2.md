# Understanding the Needs and Expectations of Interested Parties

**Understanding the needs and expectations of interested parties** involves identifying stakeholders who can affect or be affected by the organizationâ€™s QMS. These stakeholders include:

1. **Customers**: Their requirements and satisfaction levels.
2. **Employees**: Their needs for training, development, and work environment.
3. **Suppliers and Partners**: Their capabilities, reliability, and expectations.
4. **Regulatory Bodies**: Compliance with laws, regulations, and industry standards.
5. **Investors and Shareholders**: Their expectations regarding returns and corporate governance.
6. **Community and Society**: Social responsibility and environmental impact.

By understanding these needs and expectations, the organization can ensure that its QMS is designed to meet or exceed them, thereby improving overall satisfaction and compliance.
