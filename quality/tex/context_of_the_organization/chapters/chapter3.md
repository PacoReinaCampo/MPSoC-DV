# Determining the Scope of the Quality Management System

**Determining the scope of the quality management system** is about defining the boundaries and applicability of the QMS within the organization. This involves:

1. **Consideration of Internal and External Issues**: How these issues influence the organization’s strategic direction.
2. **Identification of Products and Services**: What the organization offers and the processes involved.
3. **Exclusions**: Identifying any requirements of ISO 9001:2015 that are not applicable due to the nature of the organization or its products and services, along with justifications for these exclusions.

The scope should be documented and available to all relevant parties. It should reflect the organization’s activities, products, services, and the interplay with stakeholders.
