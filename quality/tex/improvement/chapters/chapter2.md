# NONCONFORMITY AND CORRECTIVE ACTION

Nonconformities are instances where processes or outputs do not meet specified requirements. The organization must address these through a structured approach involving corrective actions.

1. **Handling Nonconformities**:
   - **Identify**: Detect and document nonconformities.
   - **Respond**: Take action to control and correct the nonconformity, mitigate its impacts, and evaluate the need for actions to eliminate the cause.
   - **Corrective Actions**: Implement actions to prevent recurrence by addressing the root causes.

2. **Process for Corrective Actions**:
   - **Root Cause Analysis**: Determine the underlying reasons for the nonconformity.
   - **Action Plan**: Develop and implement a plan to address the root causes.
   - **Effectiveness**: Verify that the corrective actions taken are effective and prevent recurrence.
   - **Documentation**: Maintain records of the nature of nonconformities, actions taken, and the results of those actions.

3. **Review and Update**:
   - Periodically review nonconformities and corrective actions to identify trends.
   - Update processes and QMS documentation to reflect improvements and changes.
