# QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND ITS PROCESSES

**Quality management system and its processes** involve establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving the QMS and its processes. This includes:

1. **Process Identification**: Identifying the key processes needed for the QMS and their interrelations.
2. **Process Approach**: Managing processes and their interactions to achieve intended outcomes.
3. **Process Mapping**: Visualizing the processes and their flow within the QMS.
4. **Performance Metrics**: Establishing key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor and measure the effectiveness of processes.
5. **Risk-Based Thinking**: Incorporating risk assessment and management into the processes to prevent undesired outcomes.
6. **Resource Allocation**: Ensuring that necessary resources (human, infrastructure, environment) are available to execute processes effectively.
7. **Documentation and Records**: Maintaining documented information to support the operation and control of processes.

By focusing on these elements, the organization ensures that its QMS is aligned with its strategic goals, meets stakeholder expectations, and is capable of delivering consistent and high-quality products or services.

In summary, the **Context of the Organization** section in ISO 9001:2015 is about understanding the factors that influence the QMS, identifying the needs and expectations of stakeholders, defining the scope of the QMS, and establishing a process-based approach to managing quality. This comprehensive understanding helps organizations design and implement an effective QMS that is aligned with their strategic objectives and responsive to changing internal and external conditions.
