# QUALITY OBJECTIVES AND PLANNING TO ACHIEVE THEM

**Purpose**: To establish measurable and achievable quality objectives that are aligned with the organization's quality policy and strategic direction.

**Approach**:

1. **Setting Quality Objectives**:

   - Objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
   - They should reflect the organization's commitment to customer satisfaction, regulatory compliance, and continuous improvement.

2. **Planning to Achieve Objectives**:

   - Determine what will be done to achieve these objectives.
   - Identify the necessary resources, including personnel, equipment, and training.
   - Assign responsibility and authority for achieving each objective.
   - Establish timeframes and milestones to monitor progress.

**Examples**:

- **Objective**: Reduce the defect rate by 10% within the next year.
- **Plan**: Implement additional quality checks at key stages of the production process, provide training for quality inspectors, and monitor defect rates monthly.
