# PLANNING OF CHANGES

**Purpose**: To ensure that any changes to the QMS are conducted in a controlled manner and do not negatively impact the system's integrity or the quality of products and services.

**Approach**:

1. **Identifying Changes**: Recognize the need for changes that may arise from internal or external factors, such as new regulations, technological advancements, or market conditions.

2. **Evaluating Changes**:

   * Assess the potential impact of the changes on the QMS, including risks and benefits.
   * Consider how the changes will affect existing processes, resources, and responsibilities.

3. **Planning Changes**:

   * Define the steps necessary to implement the changes, including resource allocation and timeline.
   * Communicate the planned changes to all relevant parties to ensure understanding and buy-in.

4. **Implementing Changes**:

   * Execute the change plan, ensuring that all actions are documented and monitored.
   * Evaluate the effectiveness of the changes and make adjustments as necessary.

**Examples**:

   * **Change**: Introducing a new software system for managing quality records.
   * **Plan**: Develop a rollout plan that includes training for users, migrating existing records to the new system, and establishing support procedures.

In summary, the **Planning** section of ISO 9001:2015 ensures that an organization systematically addresses risks and opportunities, sets and achieves quality objectives, and manages changes in a way that maintains or improves the effectiveness of its QMS. This proactive and structured approach is essential for continual improvement and sustained success in meeting customer and regulatory requirements.
