# CONTROL OF NONCONFORMING OUTPUTS

The organization must establish procedures for identifying, segregating, and controlling nonconforming products and services to prevent their unintended use or delivery. This includes:

   * Documenting nonconformities and initiating corrective actions to address root causes.
   * Obtaining authorization before reworking or disposing of nonconforming products and services.

In summary, the **Operation** section of ISO 9001:2015 outlines requirements for effectively planning, controlling, and executing operational processes to ensure that products and services meet customer requirements and are delivered consistently with high quality. This includes defining requirements, designing and developing products and services, controlling externally provided processes, production and service provision, release of products and services, and control of nonconforming outputs. These requirements help organizations establish robust processes for delivering products and services that consistently meet customer expectations.
