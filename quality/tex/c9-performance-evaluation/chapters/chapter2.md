**Internal audit process** involves:

   * Ensure audits cover all aspects of the QMS and are conducted regularly.

2. **Selecting and training auditors**:

   * Provide training to ensure they are competent.

3. **Conducting audits and reporting findings**:

   * Carry out audits according to the plan, gather evidence, and report nonconformities.
   * Ensure findings are documented and communicated to relevant management.

4. **Taking corrective actions**:

   * Address nonconformities and their causes.
   * Verify the effectiveness of corrective actions.
