# Resources

## General

An organization must determine and provide the resources needed for the establishment, implementation, maintenance, and continual improvement of the QMS. This includes considering the capabilities and constraints on existing internal resources, as well as what needs to be obtained from external providers.

## People

The organization must ensure it has sufficient personnel with the necessary competencies to effectively implement the QMS, operate processes, and achieve conformity of products and services. This involves:

- Identifying human resource needs.
- Providing necessary training and development.
- Ensuring staff have the appropriate skills and qualifications.

## Infrastructure

Infrastructure refers to the facilities, equipment, and support services necessary for the operation of processes and to achieve conformity of products and services. This includes:

- Buildings and workspace.
- Utilities such as electricity and water.
- Equipment such as machinery and tools.
- Information and communication technology.

## Environment for the Operation of Processes

The organization must provide and manage the environment necessary for the operation of its processes. This includes both physical and non-physical factors, such as:

- Physical factors: Cleanliness, temperature, humidity, lighting, and noise.
- Non-physical factors: Workplace culture, morale, and well-being.

## Monitoring and Measuring Resources

### General

The organization must determine and provide the necessary resources to ensure valid and reliable monitoring and measurement results. This includes:

- Identifying what needs to be measured and monitored.
- Ensuring measurement devices are suitable and properly maintained.
- Establishing processes for calibration and verification of measurement devices.

### Measurement Traceability

Where traceability is a requirement, measurement instruments must be calibrated or verified at specified intervals against standards traceable to international or national measurement standards. If no such standards exist, the basis used for calibration or verification must be recorded. This ensures accuracy and reliability of measurements critical to the QMS.

## Organizational Knowledge

Organizational knowledge is the information necessary for the operation of processes and to achieve conformity of products and services. This includes:

- Capturing and sharing knowledge gained from experience.
- Learning from lessons learned, both successes and failures.
- Ensuring the availability of this knowledge to those who need it.
