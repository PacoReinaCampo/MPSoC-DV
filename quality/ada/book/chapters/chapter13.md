# REPRESENTATION ISSUES

## OPERATIONAL AND REPRESENTATION ASPECTS

### Aspect Specifications

Aspect specifications in Ada provide control over operational and representation aspects of data types.

```ada
type Integer_Stack is new Stack with record
    pragma Pack (Stack);
end record;
```

## PACKED TYPES

Packed types in Ada allow data elements to be stored contiguously without padding for alignment.

```ada
type Packed_Record is record
    Field1 : Integer;
    Field2 : Float;
    pragma Pack (Packed_Record);
end record;
```

## OPERATIONAL AND REPRESENTATION ATTRIBUTES

Operational and representation attributes in Ada provide additional control over how data is stored and accessed.

```ada
for Record_Type'Alignment use 4;
```

## ENUMERATION REPRESENTATION CLAUSES

Enumeration representation clauses in Ada allow specifying the size and storage of enumeration types.

```ada
type Color is (Red, Green, Blue);
for Color use (16#FF0000#, 16#00FF00#, 16#0000FF#);
for Color'Size use 8;
```

## RECORD LAYOUT

### Record Representation Clauses

Record representation clauses in Ada specify how records are laid out in memory.

```ada
type Person_Record is record
    Name : String (1 .. 100);
    Age : Integer;
    Address : String (1 .. 200);
    pragma Pack (Person_Record);
end record;
```

### Storage Place Attributes

Storage place attributes in Ada define the memory location for variables.

```ada
for Variable'Address use System.Storage_Elements.To_Address (0);
```

### Bit Ordering

Bit ordering in Ada specifies the order of bits within a byte or across multiple bytes.

```ada
for Bit_Order use System.Standard'Bit_Order;
```

## CHANGE OF REPRESENTATION

Change of representation in Ada allows altering how data is interpreted or accessed.

```ada
type Big_Endian_Integer is new Integer;
for Big_Endian_Integer'Bit_Order use System.Big_Endian;
```

## THE PACKAGE SYSTEM

### The Package System. Storage_Elements

The `Storage_Elements` package in Ada provides facilities for managing low-level storage operations.

```ada
with System.Storage_Elements;
```

### The Package System. Address_To_Access_Conversions

The `Address_To_Access_Conversions` package in Ada provides conversions between addresses and access types.

```ada
with System.Address_To_Access_Conversions;
```

## MACHINE CODE INSERTIONS

Machine code insertions in Ada allow embedding assembly code within Ada programs.

```ada
pragma Machine_Assembly (Insert_Assembly_Code);
```

## UNCHECKED TYPE CONVERSIONS

### Data Validity

Unchecked type conversions in Ada allow converting between types without runtime checks.

```ada
X := Float (Y);  -- Unchecked type conversion
```

### The Valid Attribute

The `Valid` attribute in Ada checks the validity of data after unchecked type conversions.

```ada
if X'Valid then
    -- Valid data
else
    -- Invalid data
end if;
```

## UNCHECKED ACCESS VALUE CREATION

Unchecked access value creation in Ada allows creating access values without runtime checks.

```ada
A := unchecked new Integer'Access;
```

## STORAGE MANAGEMENT

### Storage Allocation Attributes

Storage allocation attributes in Ada manage memory allocation for variables and objects.

```ada
for Object'Storage_Pool use Pool_Name;
```

### Unchecked Storage Deallocation

Unchecked storage deallocation in Ada allows freeing memory without runtime checks.

```ada
unchecked deallocate (Object);
```

### Default Storage Pools

Default storage pools in Ada manage memory allocation by default for objects.

```ada
pragma Default_Storage_Pool (Pool_Name);
```

### Storage Subpools

Storage subpools in Ada manage subsets of memory within a storage pool.

```ada
pragma Storage_Pool (Subpool_Name);
```

### Subpool Reclamation

Subpool reclamation in Ada allows reclaiming memory from subpools when no longer needed.

```ada
pragma Finalize_Storage_Pool (Subpool_Name);
```

### Storage Subpool Example

An example illustrating the use of storage subpools in Ada.

```ada
pragma Storage_Pool (Data_Pool);
```

## PRAGMA RESTRICTIONS AND PRAGMA PROFILE

### Language-Defined Restrictions and Profiles

Pragma restrictions and profiles in Ada define rules and configurations for specific language features.

```ada
pragma Restrictions (No_Implementation_Attributes);
```

## STREAMS

### The Package Streams

The `Streams` package in Ada provides facilities for stream-oriented input and output operations.

```ada
with Ada.Streams;
```

### Stream-Oriented Attributes

Stream-oriented attributes in Ada manage stream behavior and configuration.

```ada
pragma Input (Stream_Name);
```

## FREEZING RULES

Freezing rules in Ada define when and how entities are frozen during compilation and execution.

```ada
pragma Freeze (Freeze_Rule);
```

This manual outline covers the detailed aspects of representation issues in the Ada programming language, including operational and representation aspects, packed types, operational and representation attributes, enumeration representation clauses, record layout and attributes, change of representation, the package system (`Storage_Elements` and `Address_To_Access_Conversions`), machine code insertions, unchecked type conversions, unchecked access value creation, storage management (allocation, deallocation, pools, subpools), pragma restrictions and profiles, streams (`Streams` package), and freezing rules. Each section can be expanded with specific syntax rules, examples, and further details as needed.
