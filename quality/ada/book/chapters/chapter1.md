# GENERAL

## SCOPE

### Extent

Ada is a high-level programming language intended for software engineering, emphasizing strong typing, modularity, and reliability.

### Structure

The language is structured around packages, procedures, functions, tasks, and generics. It supports object-oriented and concurrent programming paradigms.

### Conformity of an Implementation with the Standard

Ada compilers must adhere to the Ada Reference Manual (ARM), maintained by the Ada Resource Association (ARA) and updated periodically. Compliance ensures portability and interoperability across different implementations.

### Method of Description and Syntax Notation

The Ada language syntax is formally described using Backus-Naur Form (BNF), as specified in the Ada Reference Manual. The manual provides detailed rules and conventions for writing Ada programs.

### Classification of Errors

Errors in Ada are classified into syntax errors, semantic errors (type mismatch, etc.), and runtime errors (such as exceptions). The language supports exception handling to manage runtime errors gracefully.

## NORMATIVE REFERENCES

The Ada Reference Manual (ARM), maintained by the Ada Resource Association (ARA), serves as the primary normative reference for the language specifications. It includes detailed syntax, semantics, and guidelines for writing Ada programs.

## TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

   * **Package**: A unit of Ada program structure encapsulating types, constants, variables, procedures, and functions.
   * **Procedure**: A subprogram that performs a specific task and can be called from other parts of the program.
   * **Function**: A subprogram that returns a value based on its inputs.
   * **Task**: A concurrent unit of execution in Ada, used for multitasking applications.
   * **Generic**: A parameterized construct in Ada that allows writing reusable components.
   * **Exception**: An abnormal condition that occurs during program execution, which can be handled using Ada's exception handling mechanisms.
   * **ARM**: Ada Reference Manual, the definitive source of language specifications and rules.

This manual outline covers the essential aspects of the Ada programming language, focusing on scope, normative references, and key terms and definitions. Each section can be further expanded with specific details and examples as required.
