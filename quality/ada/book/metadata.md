abstract: Welcome to The Ada Programming Language, an introductory book about Ada. The Ada programming language helps you write faster, more reliable software. High-level ergonomics and low-level control are often at odds in programming language design; Ada challenges that conflict. Through balancing powerful technical capacity and a great developer experience, Ada gives you the option to control low-level details (such as memory usage) without all the hassle traditionally associated with such control.
