# A WEB SERVER

A web server in Go is a program that listens for incoming HTTP requests and serves responses based on those requests. Go provides a powerful standard library package called `net/http` for building web servers. With this package, you can quickly create robust and efficient HTTP servers to handle various types of web applications.

Here's a basic example of how to create a simple web server in Go:

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "net/http"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, World!") // Write response to client
}

func main() {
  http.HandleFunc("/", handler)      // Register handler function
  http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)  // Start server on port 8080
}
```

In this example:

- We import the required packages (`fmt` and `net/http`).
- We define a handler function (`handler`) that takes an `http.ResponseWriter` and an `http.Request` as parameters. This function writes "Hello, World!" as the response body to the client using `fmt.Fprintf`.
- We register the handler function with the root path (`/`) using `http.HandleFunc`.
- We start the HTTP server using `http.ListenAndServe`, specifying the port to listen on (`:8080`). This function blocks indefinitely, serving incoming requests until an error occurs.

To run the server, save the code in a file (e.g., `server.go`) and execute it using the `go run` command:

```
go run server.go
```

Now, if you open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`, you should see "Hello, World!" displayed in the browser.

This example demonstrates the basic structure of a web server in Go. However, Go's `net/http` package offers much more functionality, including routing, middleware, serving static files, handling form submissions, and more. With Go's simplicity and efficiency, you can quickly build powerful web applications.
