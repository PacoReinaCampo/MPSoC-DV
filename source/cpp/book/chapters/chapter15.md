# Numerics library
The Numerics library in C++ provides a range of functionalities for numerical computations and operations. Let's explore each component you've mentioned

## Common math functions
The Numerics library includes common mathematical functions such as trigonometric functions (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`), exponential and logarithmic functions (`exp`, `log`, `log10`), and other elementary functions (`sqrt`, `pow`, `abs`). These functions operate on numerical data types like `float`, `double`, and `long double`.

## Mathematical special functions (C++17)
C++17 introduced support for mathematical special functions, which include a variety of functions beyond elementary ones. These special functions encompass a wide range of mathematical concepts such as Bessel functions (`j0`, `j1`, `jn`), elliptic integrals (`ellint_1`, `ellint_2`, `ellint_3`), gamma functions (`tgamma`, `lgamma`), and many more. They are essential in various scientific and engineering applications.

## Mathematical constants (C++20)
C++20 introduced support for mathematical constants like π (pi) and e (Euler's number). These constants are provided as predefined values (`std::numbers::pi`, `std::numbers::e`) and are useful for mathematical computations requiring precise values of these constants.

## Basic linear algebra algorithms (C++26)
C++26 is expected to introduce basic linear algebra algorithms, providing functionalities for common linear algebra operations like matrix addition, multiplication, decomposition, and solving systems of linear equations. These algorithms will be crucial for numerical simulations, scientific computing, and machine learning applications.

## Numeric algorithms
The Numerics library includes a wide range of numeric algorithms for various tasks such as sorting (`std::sort`), searching (`std::binary_search`), mathematical accumulation (`std::accumulate`), and statistical computations (`std::mean`, `std::median`, `std::variance`). These algorithms operate on ranges of elements and are essential for numerical computations and data analysis.

## Pseudo-random number generation
C++ provides utilities for generating pseudo-random numbers using the `<random>` header. It includes various random number generators (such as `std::mt19937` and `std::default_random_engine`) and distributions (such as uniform distribution, normal distribution, and discrete distribution) for generating random numbers with different characteristics.

## Floating-point environment (C++11)
C++11 introduced facilities for managing and querying the floating-point environment, including functions like `std::fetestexcept` for testing floating-point exceptions and macros like `FLT_EVAL_METHOD` for querying the floating-point evaluation method used by the compiler.

## complex − valarray
The Numerics library includes support for complex numbers (`std::complex`) and numerical arrays (`std::valarray`). Complex numbers are useful for representing and manipulating complex mathematical entities, while valarrays provide facilities for numerical array operations like element-wise arithmetic operations and mathematical functions.

Overall, the Numerics library in C++ provides a rich set of functionalities for numerical computations, mathematical operations, and statistical analysis, making C++ a versatile language for scientific computing, engineering, and data analysis tasks.
