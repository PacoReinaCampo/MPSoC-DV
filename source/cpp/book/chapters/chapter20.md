# CONCURRENCY SUPPORT LIBRARY (C++11)

The Concurrency Support library in C++11 provides functionalities for writing multithreaded and concurrent programs, allowing developers to leverage the full potential of modern hardware with multiple CPU cores. Let's explore the components you've mentioned

## THREAD − JTHREAD (C++20)

The `std::thread` class in C++11 allows developers to create and manage threads of execution. Threads are lightweight processes that run concurrently with other threads in a program. They are useful for parallelizing tasks and utilizing multiple CPU cores effectively. C++20 introduced the `std::jthread` class, which is a joinable thread with automatic cleanup upon destruction, providing safer and more convenient thread management compared to `std::thread`.

## ATOMIC − ATOMIC_FLAG

The `std::atomic` template class in C++11 provides atomic operations for shared variables accessed by multiple threads concurrently. Atomic operations ensure that operations on shared variables are performed atomically, without the risk of data races or undefined behavior. `std::atomic_flag` is a specialization of `std::atomic` for boolean flags, providing lock-free atomic operations for simple synchronization primitives.

## ATOMIC_REF (C++20) − MEMORY_ORDER

C++20 introduced `std::atomic_ref`, which allows atomic operations on non-atomic variables by providing a reference wrapper to the variable. This enables atomic operations on existing variables without the need to make them atomic. Additionally, C++11 introduced the `memory_order` enumeration, which allows developers to specify the memory ordering constraints for atomic operations, ensuring correct synchronization and consistency between threads.

## MUTUAL EXCLUSION − SEMAPHORES (C++20)

Mutual exclusion mechanisms such as mutexes and semaphores are essential for coordinating access to shared resources among multiple threads. C++11 provides `std::mutex` for mutual exclusion and `std::unique_lock` for scoped locking. C++20 introduced `std::binary_semaphore` and `std::counting_semaphore`, which provide semaphore-based synchronization primitives for coordinating access to shared resources.

## CONDITION VARIABLES − FUTURES

Condition variables (`std::condition_variable`) allow threads to wait for certain conditions to become true before proceeding. They are often used in combination with mutexes to implement complex synchronization patterns. Futures (`std::future`) represent asynchronous computations and provide a mechanism for retrieving the result of a computation that may be running concurrently in another thread.

## LATCH (C++20) − BARRIER (C++20)

C++20 introduced `std::latch` and `std::barrier`, which are synchronization primitives for coordinating the execution of multiple threads. A latch is a synchronization primitive that allows a fixed number of threads to wait until a certain condition is satisfied before proceeding. A barrier is a synchronization primitive that allows a group of threads to synchronize at a predefined point in their execution, ensuring that all threads reach the barrier before any thread proceeds further.

## SAFE RECLAMATION (C++26)

C++26 is expected to introduce safe reclamation mechanisms for managing memory and resources in multithreaded environments. These mechanisms aim to provide efficient and safe memory reclamation for lock-free data structures and algorithms, enabling developers to write concurrent code with better performance and reliability.

Overall, the Concurrency Support library in C++ provides a rich set of functionalities for writing multithreaded and concurrent programs, including thread management, atomic operations, mutual exclusion, synchronization primitives, and safe memory reclamation mechanisms. These features enable developers to write efficient and scalable concurrent code while ensuring correct behavior and avoiding common concurrency pitfalls such as data races and deadlocks.
