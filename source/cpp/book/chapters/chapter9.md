# Metaprogramming library (C++11)

The Metaprogramming library in C++ provides facilities for compile-time computation and type manipulation. Let's explore the components you've mentioned:

## Type traits âˆ’ ratio

Type traits in C++ are templates that provide information about types at compile-time. They allow programmers to query properties of types and perform conditional compilation based on those properties. In C++11, the `<ratio>` header introduces the `std::ratio` template, which represents a rational number with a numerator and a denominator. It is commonly used in conjunction with other facilities like `std::chrono` to specify time durations and ratios.

## integer_sequence (C++14)

`std::integer_sequence` is a utility introduced in C++14 that represents a sequence of integers. It is often used in conjunction with variadic templates to generate sequences of indices or to expand parameter packs into multiple function arguments. `std::integer_sequence` simplifies the implementation of certain metaprogramming tasks, such as tuple manipulation, function parameter unpacking, and loop unrolling.

Together, these components of the Metaprogramming library in C++ provide powerful tools for performing computations and manipulations at compile-time. They enable developers to write more expressive, efficient, and flexible code by leveraging the capabilities of the C++ compiler to perform complex transformations and optimizations during the compilation process.
