# Regular expressions library (C++11)

The Regular Expressions library introduced in C++11 provides a powerful and flexible mechanism for pattern matching and text processing. Let's delve into the components you've mentioned:

## basic_regex âˆ’ Algorithms

`std::basic_regex` is a template class representing a compiled regular expression pattern. It serves as the foundation for working with regular expressions in C++, allowing developers to create, compile, and use regular expression patterns for searching, matching, and replacing text within strings.

The Regular Expressions library in C++ provides a range of algorithms for working with regular expressions, including searching for matches (`std::regex_search`), matching entire strings (`std::regex_match`), finding and replacing matches (`std::regex_replace`), and splitting strings based on matching patterns (`std::regex_split`).

These algorithms operate on `std::basic_string` or `std::string_view` objects and allow developers to perform various text processing tasks efficiently and conveniently using regular expressions.

## Default regular expression grammar

The Regular Expressions library in C++11 adopts the ECMAScript regular expression grammar as the default syntax for defining regular expression patterns. This grammar is widely used and familiar to developers from other programming languages, making it easy to write and understand regular expressions in C++.

The ECMAScript regular expression grammar supports a wide range of features, including character classes (`[...]`), quantifiers (`*`, `+`, `?`), alternation (`|`), grouping (`(...)`) and backreferences (`\1`, `\2`), allowing developers to create complex and expressive patterns for matching text.

Overall, the Regular Expressions library in C++11 provides a robust and efficient framework for working with regular expressions, allowing developers to perform sophisticated text processing tasks with ease and confidence. It leverages the widely-used ECMAScript regular expression grammar and provides a range of algorithms for searching, matching, and manipulating text using regular expressions.
