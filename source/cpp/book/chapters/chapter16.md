# Date and time library

The Date and Time library in C++ provides functionalities for handling dates, times, and time zones, facilitating the manipulation and management of temporal data. Let's explore the components you've mentioned:

## Calendar (C++20) − Time zone (C++20)

### Calendar (C++20)

The Calendar feature introduced in C++20 provides a standardized mechanism for working with dates and calendars. It includes functionalities for representing and manipulating dates, determining the day of the week, calculating the difference between dates, and converting between different calendar systems (e.g., Gregorian, Julian). The Calendar feature enhances the expressiveness and robustness of date-related operations in C++, providing a consistent interface for working with dates across different platforms and locales.

### Time zone (C++20)

The Time Zone feature introduced in C++20 addresses the complexities of handling time zones and daylight saving time (DST) transitions. It provides functionalities for representing time zones, converting between different time zones, and handling DST transitions. With the Time Zone feature, developers can accurately represent and manipulate time zone-aware datetime values, ensuring correct behavior when dealing with temporal data across different geographical regions and time zones. Additionally, the Time Zone feature helps address issues related to time zone ambiguity and DST transitions, providing a more reliable and standardized approach to handling time zone-related operations in C++ applications.

Overall, the Date and Time library enhancements introduced in C++20, including the Calendar and Time Zone features, improve the capabilities and usability of date and time functionalities in C++. They provide standardized mechanisms for working with dates, calendars, and time zones, enabling developers to write more robust and reliable applications that deal with temporal data accurately and efficiently.
