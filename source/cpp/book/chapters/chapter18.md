# INPUT/OUTPUT LIBRARY

The Input/Output (I/O) library in C++ provides a comprehensive set of functionalities for performing input and output operations, including console I/O, file I/O, and stream-based I/O. Let's explore each component you've mentioned:

## PRINT FUNCTIONS (C++23)

The Print functions feature, expected to be introduced in C++23, aims to enhance the standard library's capabilities for printing formatted output to the console or other output devices. It may introduce new functions or improvements to existing functions for printing data with enhanced formatting options, improved performance, or better integration with other library features.

## STREAM-BASED I/O − I/O MANIPULATORS

C++ provides stream-based I/O facilities through the `std::basic_istream` and `std::basic_ostream` classes, which serve as base classes for input and output streams, respectively. These classes are templated on the character type (`char` or `wchar_t`) and provide a flexible and extensible framework for performing formatted I/O operations.

I/O manipulators are special functions or objects that modify the behavior of input and output streams. They can be used to control formatting options such as field width, precision, alignment, and decimal point placement. Common manipulators include `std::setw`, `std::setprecision`, `std::left`, `std::right`, `std::fixed`, and `std::scientific`.

## BASIC_ISTREAM − BASIC_OSTREAM

`std::basic_istream` and `std::basic_ostream` are template classes representing input and output streams, respectively. They provide a common interface for performing formatted input and output operations on sequences of characters. These classes serve as base classes for more specialized stream classes like `std::istream` and `std::ostream`, which use `char` as the character type, and `std::wistream` and `std::wostream`, which use `wchar_t` as the character type.

## SYNCHRONIZED OUTPUT (C++20)

The Synchronized output feature introduced in C++20 provides mechanisms for ensuring thread-safe output to standard output streams (`std::cout`, `std::cerr`, `std::clog`) in multi-threaded programs. It ensures that output from multiple threads is properly synchronized and interleaved in a predictable manner, preventing garbled or out-of-order output.

## FILE SYSTEMS (C++17)

The File Systems library introduced in C++17 provides functionalities for performing file system operations such as querying file attributes, manipulating paths, iterating over directory contents, and creating, deleting, and renaming files and directories. It aims to standardize and simplify file system-related operations, making it easier for developers to work with files and directories in a platform-independent manner.

Overall, the Input/Output library in C++ offers a rich set of functionalities for performing input and output operations, including stream-based I/O, file I/O, formatted I/O, and thread-safe output. These features enable developers to build robust and efficient applications that can handle various input and output scenarios, from simple console-based interaction to complex file system operations and multi-threaded output synchronization.
