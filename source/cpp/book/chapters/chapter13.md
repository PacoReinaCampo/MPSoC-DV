# Iterators library
The Iterators library in C++ provides a mechanism for traversing and accessing elements in sequences, such as arrays, containers, or ranges. Iterators act as pointers to elements within a range, allowing for generic algorithms to operate on different data structures in a uniform manner. Here's an explanation of the Iterators library and the Ranges library introduced in C++20:

- **Iterator Concepts**: The Iterators library defines a set of iterator concepts that categorize iterators based on their capabilities and behavior. These concepts include input iterators, output iterators, forward iterators, bidirectional iterators, random access iterators, and more. They provide a standardized way to classify and reason about iterators, enabling generic algorithms to work with different types of iterators.

- **Iterator Adapters**: Iterator adapters are utility classes that transform iterators into different types or modify their behavior. Examples include `std::reverse_iterator`, which reverses the direction of traversal, and `std::move_iterator`, which converts iterators to move iterators for use with move semantics.

- **Iterator Functions**: The Iterators library also provides a set of functions for working with iterators, such as `std::advance`, `std::distance`, and `std::next`, which allow for advancing iterators, calculating distances between iterators, and obtaining iterators at specified offsets, respectively.

## Ranges library (C++20)
The Ranges library introduced in C++20 builds upon the concepts and functionality of the Iterators library, providing a more expressive and composable way to work with sequences of elements. It introduces range-based abstractions that encapsulate both the data and the operations performed on it. Here are some key features of the Ranges library:

- **Range Concepts**: The Ranges library defines a set of range concepts that categorize ranges based on their capabilities and behavior. These concepts include range, view, sized range, input range, forward range, bidirectional range, random access range, and more. They provide a standardized way to classify and reason about ranges, similar to iterator concepts.

- **Range Adapters**: Range adapters are composable transformations that modify or extend ranges in a declarative manner. Examples include `std::views::filter`, `std::views::transform`, `std::views::take`, and `std::views::drop`, which filter, transform, take, and drop elements from a range, respectively.

- **Range Algorithms**: The Ranges library provides a set of range-based algorithms that operate on ranges instead of iterators. These algorithms are designed to work seamlessly with range-based abstractions and offer improved readability, expressiveness, and performance compared to their iterator-based counterparts.

- **Pipelines**: Ranges support pipeline-style composition of operations, where multiple transformations are chained together to form a pipeline. This allows for concise and expressive code that describes the entire data processing workflow in a single expression.

Overall, the Iterators library provides a foundation for working with sequences of elements using iterators, while the Ranges library builds upon this foundation to offer more powerful and expressive abstractions for working with ranges of elements in a composable and declarative manner. Together, these libraries enable developers to write more readable, efficient, and maintainable code for processing sequences of data in C++.
