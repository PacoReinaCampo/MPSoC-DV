# General utilities library

The General Utilities library in C++ provides a wide range of utilities to enhance the functionality and expressiveness of C++ programs. Let's discuss the components you've mentioned:

## Function objects − hash (C++11)

Function objects, also known as functors, are objects that can be invoked as if they were functions. In C++11, the `<functional>` header introduces the `std::hash` template, which provides a hash function for generating hash values of objects. It is commonly used in conjunction with unordered containers like `std::unordered_map` and `std::unordered_set` to enable efficient lookup and storage of objects based on their hash values.

## Swap − Type operations (C++11)

The `swap` function in C++11, defined in the `<algorithm>` header, allows for the efficient swapping of values between two objects of the same type. It is commonly used to implement efficient swap operations for user-defined types and to optimize certain algorithms by minimizing unnecessary copies.

## Integer comparison (C++20)

In C++20, the `<compare>` header introduces standardized comparison categories for integers, including strong ordering, weak ordering, and partial ordering. This facilitates consistent and efficient comparison operations for integer types, enabling more reliable and predictable behavior in generic code.

## pair − tuple (C++11)

The `std::pair` template, introduced in C++11, represents a pair of values. It is commonly used to store two related values together, such as key-value pairs in associative containers. Similarly, the `std::tuple` template, also introduced in C++11, represents a fixed-size collection of heterogeneous values. It provides compile-time indexing and enables functions to return multiple values.

## optional (C++17)

`std::optional` is a template introduced in C++17 that represents an optional value. It encapsulates an object that may or may not exist, providing a safe and expressive way to handle potentially missing values. It is commonly used to indicate optional function parameters, return values, or container elements.

## expected (C++23)

`std::expected` is a proposed addition to the C++ standard library, expected to be introduced in C++23. It represents a value that may be either an expected value or an error. It provides a more expressive and type-safe alternative to traditional error handling mechanisms such as error codes or exceptions.

## variant (C++17) − any (C++17)

`std::variant` is a template introduced in C++17 that represents a type-safe union of alternative types. It provides a type-safe way to work with values that may be of different types at runtime. Similarly, `std::any` is a template introduced in C++17 that represents a type-safe container for single values of any type.

## String conversions (C++17)

The `<string_view>` header introduced in C++17 provides the `std::to_string` and `std::from_string` functions, which enable conversion between strings and numeric types. It allows for easy and efficient conversion of numeric values to and from string representations.

## Formatting (C++20)

C++20 introduces the `<format>` header, which provides facilities for string formatting using a format string syntax similar to Python's `str.format`. It allows for more expressive and flexible string formatting, supporting a wide range of formatting options and customization features.

## bitset − Bit manipulation (C++20)

The `std::bitset` template, introduced in C++20, represents a fixed-size sequence of bits. It provides efficient operations for setting, clearing, and querying individual bits, as well as bitwise operations such as AND, OR, XOR, and shifting.

## Debugging support (C++26)

While specific details about debugging support in C++26 are not available as of my last update, it's likely that further enhancements and improvements to debugging facilities will be introduced in this version of the language. This may include features such as enhanced debugging information, improved debugging tools, and better integration with development environments and debuggers.

Overall, the General Utilities library in C++ provides a comprehensive set of utilities for common programming tasks, ranging from basic data structures and algorithms to advanced features like error handling, string manipulation, and debugging support. These utilities enhance the expressiveness, efficiency, and reliability of C++ programs, making development easier and more productive.
