# Problem Reports

Problem reports are crucial documents in the hardware development and maintenance lifecycle. They record any issues, defects, or anomalies discovered during the design, testing, production, or operational phases of hardware. Effective problem reporting is essential for identifying, tracking, resolving, and preventing issues, ensuring the reliability and quality of the hardware.

## Purpose of Problem Reports

**Description**: The primary purpose of problem reports is to systematically document issues encountered with the hardware, facilitate their resolution, and prevent recurrence. They serve as a tool for continuous improvement and quality assurance.

**Importance**:

- **Issue Identification**: Allows for the clear identification and documentation of problems.
- **Resolution Tracking**: Tracks the progress of issue resolution, ensuring accountability and timely fixes.
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Facilitates analysis to identify the underlying causes of problems.
- **Quality Assurance**: Helps maintain the quality and reliability of the hardware by addressing defects and issues promptly.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensures compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements for documentation and issue management.
