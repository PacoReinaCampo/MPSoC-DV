# SOFTWARE QUALITY ASSURANCE PROCESS

This section discusses the objectives and activities of the software quality assurance (SQA) process. The SQA process is applied as defined by the software planning process (section 4) and the Software Quality Assurance Plan (subsection 11.5). Outputs of the SQA process activities are recorded in Software Quality Assurance Records (subsection 11.19) or other software life cycle data.

The SQA process assesses the software life cycle processes and their outputs to obtain assurance that the objectives are satisfied, that deficiencies are detected, evaluated, tracked and resolved, and that the software product and software life cycle data conform to certification requirements.

## Software Quality Assurance Process Objectives

The SQA process objectives provide confidence that the software life cycle processes produce software that conforms to its requirements by assuring that these processes are performed in compliance with the approved software plans and standards.

The objectives of the SQA process are to obtain assurance that:

   a. Software development processes and integral processes comply with approved software plans and standards.

   b. The transition criteria for the software life cycle processes are satisfied.

   c. A conformity review of the software product is conducted.

The applicability of the objectives by software level is specified in Table A-9 of Annex A.

## Software Quality Assurance Process Activities

To satisfy the SQA process objectives:

   a. The SQA process should take an active role in the activities of the software life cycle processes, and have those performing the SQA process enabled with the authority, responsibility and independence to ensure that the SQA process objectives are satisfied.

   b. The SQA process should provide assurance that software plans and standards are developed and reviewed for consistency.

   c. The SQA process should provide assurance that the software life cycle processes comply with the approved software plans and standards.

   d. The SQA process should include audits of the software development and integral processes during the software life cycle to obtain assurance that:

      (1) Software plans are available as specified in subsection 4.2.

      (2) Deviations from the software plans and standards are detected, recorded, evaluated, tracked and resolved.

      Note: It is generally accepted that early detection of process deviations assists efficient achievement of software life cycle process objectives.

      (3) Approved deviations are recorded.

      (4) The software development environment has been provided as specified in the software plans.

      (5) The problem reporting, tracking and corrective action process complies with the Software Configuration Management Plan.

      (6) Inputs provided to the software life cycle processes by the on-going system safety assessment process have been addressed.

      Note: Monitoring of the activities of software life cycle processes may be performed to provide assurance that the activities are under control.

   e. The SQA process should provide assurance that the transition criteria for the software life cycle processes have been satisfied in compliance with the approved software plans.

   f. The SQA process should provide assurance that software life cycle data is controlled in accordance with the control categories as defined in subsection 7.3 and the tables of Annex A.

   g. Prior to the delivery of software products submitted as part of a certification application, a software conformity review should be conducted.

   h. The SQA process should produce records of the SQA process activities (subsection 11.19), including audit results and evidence of completion of the software conformity review for each software product submitted as part of certification application.

## Software Conformity Review

The objective of the software conformity review is to obtain assurances, for a software product submitted as part of a certification application, that the software life cycle processes are complete, software life cycle data is complete, and the Executable Object Code is controlled and can be regenerated.

This review should determine that:

   a. Planned software life cycle process activities for certification credit, including the generation of software life cycle data, have been completed and records of their completion are retained.

   b. Software life cycle data developed from specific system requirements, safety-related requirements, or software requirements are traceable to those requirements.

   c. Software life cycle data complies with software plans and standards, and is controlled in accordance with the SCM Plan.

   d. Problem reports comply with the SCM Plan, have been evaluated and have their status recorded.

   e. Software requirement deviations are recorded and approved.

   f. The Executable Object Code can be regenerated from the archived Source Code.

   g. The approved software can be loaded successfully through the use of released instructions.

   h. Problem reports deferred from a previous software conformity review are re-evaluated to determine their status.

   i. If certification credit is sought for the use of previously developed software, the current software product baseline is traceable to the previous baseline and the approved changes to that baseline.

   Note: For post-certification software modifications, a subset of the software conformity review activities, as justified by the significance of the change, may be performed.
