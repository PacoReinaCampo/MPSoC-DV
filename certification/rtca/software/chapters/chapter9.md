# CERTIFICATION LIAISON PROCESS

The objective of the certification liaison process is to establish communication and understanding between the applicant and the certification authority throughout the software life cycle to assist the certification process.

The certification liaison process is applied as defined by the software planning process (section 4) and the Plan for Software Aspects of Certification (subsection 11.1). Table A- 10 of Annex A is a summary of the objectives and outputs of this process.

## Means of Compliance and Planning

The applicant proposes a means of compliance that defines how the development of the airborne system or equipment will satisfy the certification basis. The Plan for Software Aspects of Certification (subsection 11.1) defines the software aspects of the airborne system or equipment within the context of the proposed means of compliance. This plan also states the software level(s) as determined by the system safety assessment process. The applicant should:

   a. Submit the Plan for Software Aspects of Certification and other requested data to the certification authority for review at a point in time when the effects of changes are minimal, that is, when they can be managed within project constraints.

   b. Resolve issues identified by the certification authority concerning the planning for the software aspects of certification.

   c. Obtain agreement with the certification authority on the Plan for Software Aspects of Certification.

## Compliance Substantiation

The applicant provides evidence that the software life cycle processes satisfy the software plans. Certification authority reviews may take place at the applicant’s facilities or the applicant’s suppliers’ facilities. This may involve discussions with the applicant or its suppliers. The applicant arranges these reviews of the activities of the software life cycle processes and makes software life cycle data available as needed. The applicant should:

   a. Resolve issues raised by the certification authority as a result of its reviews.

   b. Submit the Software Accomplishment Summary (subsection 11.20) and Software Configuration Index (subsection 11.16) to the certification authority.

   c. Submit or make available other data or evidence of compliance requested by the certification authority.

## Minimum Software Life Cycle Data That Is Submitted to Certification Authority

The minimum software life cycle data that is submitted to the certification authority is:

   - Plan for Software Aspects of Certification.

   - Software Configuration Index.

   - Software Accomplishment Summary.

## Software Life Cycle Data Related to Type Design

Unless otherwise agreed by the certification authority, the regulations concerning retrieval and approval of software life cycle data related to the type design applies to:

   - Software Requirements Data.

   - Design Description.

   - Source Code.

   - Executable Object Code.

   - Software Configuration Index.

   - Software Accomplishment Summary.
