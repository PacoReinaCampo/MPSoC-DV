# SOFTWARE LIFE CYCLE DATA

Data is produced during the software life cycle to plan, direct, explain, define, record, or provide evidence of activities. This data enables the software life cycle processes, system or equipment certification, and post-certification modification of the software product. This section discusses the characteristics, form, configuration management controls, and content of the software life cycle data.

The characteristics of the software life cycle data are:

   a. Unambiguous: Information is unambiguous if it is written in terms which only allow a single interpretation, aided if necessary by a definition.

   b. Complete: Information is complete when it includes necessary, relevant requirements and/or descriptive material, responses are defined for the range of valid input data, figures used are labeled, and terms and units of measure are defined.

   c. Verifiable: Information is verifiable if it can be checked for correctness by a person or tool.

   d. Consistent: Information is consistent if there are no conflicts within it.

   e. Modifiable: Information is modifiable if it is structured and has a style such that changes can be made completely, consistently, and correctly while retaining the structure.

   f. Traceable: Information is traceable if the origin of its components can be determined. In addition, this guidance applies:

   g. Form: The form should provide for the efficient retrieval and review of software fife cycle data throughout the service life of the airborne system or equipment. The data and the specific form of the data should be specified in the Plan for Software Aspects of Certification.

Note: (1) The software life cycle data may take a number of forms. For example, it can be in written form, as computer files stored on magnetic media, or as displays on a remote terminal. It may be packaged as individual documents, combined into larger documents, or distributed across several documents.

Note: (2) The Plan for Software Aspects of Certification and the Software Accomplishment Summary may be required as separate printed documents by some certification authorities.

Software life cycle data can be placed in one of two categories associated with the software configuration management controls applied: Control Category 1 (CC1) and Control Category 2 (CC2) (subsection 7.3). This distinction provides a means to manage development costs where less stringent controls can be applied without a reduction in safety. The minimum control category assigned to each data item, and its variation by software level is specified in Annex A.

The following data descriptions define the data generally produced to aid in the software aspects of the certification process. The descriptions are not intended to describe all data necessary to develop a software product, and are not intended to imply a particular data packaging method or organization of the data within a package.

In addition to the data defined in these subsections, other data may be produced as evidence to aid the certification process.

   h. Control: If intended to be used for this purpose, this data should be defined in the software plan which defines the process for which the data will be produced. While the nature and content of this data may vary, as a minimum, CC2 controls should be applied. Examples include memoranda and meeting minutes.
