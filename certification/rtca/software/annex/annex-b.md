These definitions are provided for the terms which are used in this document. If a term is not defined in this annex, it is possible that it is defined instead in the body of this document. Refer to the American Heritage Dictionary for the definition of common terms.

Algorithm - A finite set of well-defined rules that gives a sequence of operations for performing a specific task.

Anomalous behavior - Behavior that is inconsistent with specified requirements.

Applicant - A person or organization seeking approval from the certification authority.

Approval - The act or instance of expressing a favorable opinion or giving formal or official sanction.

Audit - An independent examination of the software life cycle processes and their outputs to confirm required attributes.

Baseline - The approved, recorded configuration of one or more configuration items, that thereafter serves as the basis for further development, and that is changed only through change control procedures.

Certification - Legal recognition by the certification authority that a product, service, organization or person complies with the requirements. Such certification comprises the activity of technically checking the product, service, organization or person and the formal recognition of compliance with the applicable requirements by issue of a certificate, license, approval or other documents as required by national laws and procedures. In particular, certification of a product involves: (a) the process of assessing the design of a product to ensure that it complies with a set of standards applicable to that type of product so as to demonstrate an acceptable level of safety; (b) the process of assessing an individual product to ensure that it conforms with the certified type design; (c) the issuance of a certificate required by national laws to declare that compliance or conformity has been found with standards in accordance with items (a) or (b) above.

Certification Authority - The organization or person responsible within the state or country concerned with the certification of compliance with the requirements.

Note: A matter concerned with aircraft, engine or propeller type certification or with equipment approval would usually be addressed by the certification authority; matters concerned with continuing airworthiness might be addressed by what would be referred to as the airworthiness authority.

Certification credit - Acceptance by the certification authority that a process, product or demonstration satisfies a certification requirement.

Change control - (1) The process of recording, evaluating, approving or disapproving and coordinating changes to configuration items after formal establishment of their configuration identification or to baselines after their establishment. (2) The systematic evaluation, coordination, approval or disapproval and implementation of approved changes in the configuration of a configuration item after formal establishment of its configuration identification or to baselines after their establishment.

Note: This term may be called configuration control in other industry standards.
