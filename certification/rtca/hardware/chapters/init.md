# INITIALIZATION

## FOREWORD

This document was prepared by RTCA Special Committee 180 (SC-180). It was approved by the RTCA Program Management Committee on April 19, 2000.

RTCA SC-180 and the European Organization for Civil Aviation Equipment (EUROCAE) WG-46 jointly accomplished the development of this guidance through the consensus process.

RTCA, Incorporated is a not-for-profit organization formed to advance the art and science of aviation and aviation electronic systems for the benefit of the public. The organization functions as a Federal Advisory Committee and develops consensus-based recommendations on contemporary aviation issues. RTCA's objectives include but are not limited to:

   - Coalescing aviation system user and provider technical requirements in a manner that helps government and industry meet their mutual objectives and responsibilities.

   - Analyzing and recommending solutions to the system technical issues that aviation faces as it continues to pursue increased safety, system capacity and efficiency.

   - Developing consensus on the application of pertinent technology to fulfill user and provider requirements, including development of minimum operational performance standards for electronic systems and equipment that support aviation.

   - Assisting in developing the relevant technical material upon which positions for the international Civil Aviation Organization and the International Telecommunication Union and other interested international organizations can be based.

The organization's recommendations are often used as the basis for government and private sector decisions as well as the foundation for many Federal Aviation Administration Technical Standard Orders.

Since RTCA is not an official agency of the United States Government, its recommendations may not be regarded as statements of official government policy unless so enunciated by the U.S. government organization or agency having statutory jurisdiction over any matters to which the recommendations relate.

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The development and use of complex electronic hardware by the aviation industry has created new safety and certification concerns. In response, RTCA SC-180 and EUROCAE WG-46 were formed. WG- 46 and SC-180 agreed to become a joint committee early in the development of this document. This joint committee was chartered to develop clear and consistent design assurance guidance for electronic airborne hardware such that it safely performs its intended functions.

Electronic airborne hardware includes line replaceable units, circuit board assemblies, application specific integrated circuits, programmable logic devices, etc. This guidance is applicable to current, new, and emerging technologies.

The guidance in this document is intended to be used by aircraft manufacturers and suppliers of electronic hardware items for use in aircraft systems. The hardware design life cycle processes are identified. Objectives and activities for each process are described. The guidance is applicable to all hardware design assurance levels as determined by the system safety assessment.

In the development of this document, the committee considered other industry documents including Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Aerospace Recommended Practice (ARP) document ARP4754/EUROCAE ED-79, Certification Considerations for Highly Integrated or Complex Aircraft Systems; SAE ARP4761, Guidelines and Methods for Conducting the Safety Assessment Process on Civil Airborne Systems and Equipment; and RTCA DO-178/EUROCAE ED-12, Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification.
