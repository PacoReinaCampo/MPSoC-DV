# HARDWARE DESIGN LIFE CYCLE

This section outlines the hardware design life cycle discussed in Section 4 through Section 9. This document does not prescribe a preferred life cycle model, nor imply a structure for the performing organization. The hardware design life cycle is equally applicable to the development of new systems or equipment and modifications to existing systems or equipment. The life cycle for each project should be based on selection and arrangement of processes and activities determined by the attributes of the project, such as requirements stability, use of previously developed hardware and hardware design assurance levels. The hardware design life cycle processes may be iterative, that is, entered, re-entered and modified due to incremental development and feedback between the processes.

## Hardware Design Life Cycle Processes

The hardware design life cycle processes are:

1. The hardware planning process, described in Section 4, defines and coordinates the activities of the hardware design and supporting processes for a project.

2. The hardware design processes, described in Section 5, generate the design data and resultant hardware item. These processes are requirements capture, conceptual design, detailed design, implementation and production transition.

3. The supporting processes, described in Section 6 through Section 9, produce the hardware design life cycle data that assures correctness and control of the hardware design life cycle and its outputs, including planning, design, hardware safety assessment and supporting processes. These processes are typically performed concurrently with the planning and design processes. These processes are validation, verification, configuration management, process assurance and certification liaison.

## Transition Criteria

The challenges of developing a hardware item with different subitems at different stages of development require a means to provide a reasonable amount of control of the design process in order to manage the risk of starting the next process before all elements of the previous process are complete. Transition criteria, defined as the minimum data used to assess movement from one process to another, may be used at key process points. Analysis during the planning process should determine the use of transition criteria. It is not necessary to establish transition criteria between each pair of process steps defined in the plans. The selection of transition criteria should address the impact on safety. For example, before performing verification of a function for certification credit, the requirements for that function need to be documented and the implementation of that function needs to be under configuration management.

Transition criteria should be documented in the hardware plans. Use of transition criteria does not imply any particular life cycle model or prevent such development strategies as rapid prototyping and concurrent engineering.
