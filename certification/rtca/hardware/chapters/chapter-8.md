# PROCESS ASSURANCE

Process assurance ensures that the life cycle process objectives are met and activities have been completed as outlined in plans or that deviations have been addressed. This section describes the objectives for process assurance and the activities that support those objectives. There is no intent to impose specific organizational structures.

Process assurance activities should be achieved with independence in order to objectively assess the life cycle process, identify deviations and ensure corrective action.

## Process Assurance Objectives

The objectives of process assurance are to ensure that:

1. Life cycle processes comply with the approved plans.

2. Hardware design life cycle data produced complies with the approved plans.

3. The hardware item used for conformance assessment is built to comply with the associated life cycle data.

## Process Assurance Activities

Guidance for the process assurance activities includes:

1. Availability of hardware plans as specified in the planning process section of this document and as agreed to in the PHAC should be ensured.

2. Holding of reviews in compliance with the approved plans and tracking of resulting action items to closure should be ensured.

3. Detection, recording, evaluation, approval, tracking and resolution of deviations from the hardware plans and standards should be ensured.

4. Satisfaction of the transition criteria of the hardware life cycle processes in compliance with the approved plans should be ensured.

   Note: Audits are an effective method for performing activities in items 1 through 4 above.

5. An inspection should be performed to ensure that the hardware item is built in compliance with its design data.

   Note: An example of this activity is a First Article Inspection.

6. Records of the process assurance activities, including evidence of assessment of completion of design activities, should be produced.

7. Where applicable, the applicant should ensure that the processes used by  subcontractors are consistent with the hardware plans.
