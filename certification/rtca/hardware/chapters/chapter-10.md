# HARDWARE DESIGN LIFE CYCLE DATA

This section describes the hardware design life cycle data items that may be produced during the hardware design life cycle for providing evidence of design assurance and compliance with certification requirements. The scope, amount and detail of the life cycle data needed by the certification authorities as design assurance evidence will vary depending on a number of factors. These factors include the applicable certification authority requirements for the airborne system, the assigned design assurance levels, the complexity and the service experience of the hardware. Details of the design assurance evidence should be identified, recorded in the PHAC and agreed to with the certification authorities.

The additional considerations in Section 11 and the design assurance considerations for Level A and B functions in Appendix B may lead to the generation of additional life cycle data.

Appendix A indicates the hardware design life cycle data to be developed, the degree of verification independence, and the applicable data control category, as defined in Section 7 , in terms of the hardware design assurance level.

1. The hardware design life cycle data characteristics should be:

   a. Unambiguous. Information/data is written in terms that allow only a single interpretation.

   b. Complete. Information/data includes necessary and relevant requirements and descriptive material, labeled figures, and defined terms and units of measure.

   c. Verifiable. Information/data can be checked for correctness by a person or a tool.

   d. Consistent. Information/data contains no conflicts.

   e. Modifiable. Information/data is structured and changes can be made completely, consistently and correctly while retaining the structure.

   f. Traceable. Information/data origin can be determined.

   The descriptions of this section are not intended to imply a particular data packaging method, form or organization of the hardware life cycle data within a package. For example, all plans, standards, and procedures may be described in a single document or multiple documents.

2. The data packaging method, form and organization should be proposed in the PHAC and agreement with the certification authority obtained early in the program.

3. Agreed-upon information and data should be retrievable and available throughout the service life of the airborne system or equipment.
