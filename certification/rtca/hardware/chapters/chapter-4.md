# PLANNING PROCESS

This section describes the hardware planning process used to control the development of the hardware item. This process produces the hardware plans, which may be contained in one or more documents. If multiple documents are used, the main plan should contain appropriate references to the supporting documents. Standard documents covering specific hardware design life cycle processes, such as configuration management or process assurance, are acceptable provided they meet the planning objectives for the applicable process.

## Planning Process Objectives

The purpose of the hardware planning process is to define the means by which the functional and airworthiness requirements are converted into a hardware item with an acceptable amount of evidence of assurance that the item will safely perform its intended functions. The objectives of the hardware planning process are:

1. The hardware design life cycle processes are defined.

   Note: Activities, milestones, inputs, outputs and organizational responsibilities may be included in the plans.

2. Standards are selected and defined.

3. The hardware development and verification environments are selected or defined.

4. The means of compliance of the hardware design assurance objectives, including strategies identified using guidance in Section 2.3.4, are proposed to the certification authority.

   Note: New and evolving technologies, tools and processes may require details of the planning process to change. Therefore, flexibility is a key element of the planning process.

## Planning Process Activities

Guidance for the planning process includes:

1. The hardware design life cycle process, including transition criteria, if applicable, and the inter-relationships between the individual processes, such as their sequencing and feedback mechanisms, should be defined.

2. The proposed design methods should be defined and explained. This includes consideration of the expected hardware design and the rationale of the proposed verification methods.

3. Hardware design standards, if any are to be used for the project, including acceptable deviations from the standards, should be identified. These may range from generic quality standards to company or program specific standards.

   Note: Standards help reduce the probability of undetected design errors by providing a compilation of proven engineering practices determined from past developments.

The applicant and hardware developer should be aware when applying standards to new designs and new technologies, that the applicability may be invalid. Deviations from these standards may be necessary due to design constraints, conflicts with system requirements or incompatibility with new technologies. The planning process is an opportunity to review what deviations may be acceptable if standards are used.

4. The means of achieving coordination between the hardware design processes and the supporting processes, with particular attention to activities associated with systems, software and aircraft certification, should be determined.

   Note: Coordination may be in the form of a schedule showing milestones for events to accomplish the objectives of the processes described in this document.

5. The activities of each hardware design process and associated supporting processes should be defined. The definition should be at a level that enables the hardware design process and associated supporting processes to be controlled.

6. The design environment should be chosen, including the tools, procedures, software and hardware that are to be used to develop, verify and control the hardware item and the life cycle data.

   a. If certification credit is sought for use of tools in combination, the sequence of operation of the tools should be specified in the respective plan.

   b. The design environment can affect the design of a product. Section 11.4 provides guidance for the assessment of tools and determining when tool qualification may be necessary.

7. The process for deviating from the established plans, if deviations become necessary and affect certification, should be identified.

8. The policies, procedures, standards and methods to be used to identify, manage, and control the hardware, the associated baselines, and the hardware design life cycle data should be described.

9. Where the applicant intends to use subcontractors for all or part of the hardware design life cycle, the hardware plans should identify the method for ensuring that the design assurance objectives are met.

10. The policies and procedures for implementation of process assurance of the hardware design processes should be described.

11. Verification process independence, process assurance independence and associated organizational responsibilities should be described in the PHAC.

12. The means to satisfy the objectives of this guidance should be recorded and communicated to the certification authority early in the process. These means should be recorded in the PHAC.

   Note: Timely coordination of any changes to these means is encouraged to maximize acceptance of the resultant certification data as proper evidence of meeting the design assurance requirements.
