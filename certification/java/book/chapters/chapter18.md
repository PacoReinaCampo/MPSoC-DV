# PACKAGES

Packages in Java organize classes and interfaces into namespaces, providing a way to manage and access Java code more effectively.

### PACKAGE NAMING

Packages are named using a hierarchical naming convention, typically based on the organization's domain name reversed:

```java
package com.example.myapp;
```

### TYPE IMPORTS

Java allows importing types from other packages to avoid fully qualifying them:

```java
import java.util.List;
```

### PACKAGE ACCESS

Access to classes and members within a package is controlled by access modifiers (`public`, `protected`, `default`, `private`):

   * **`public`**: Accessible from any other class.
   * **`protected`**: Accessible within the same package and subclasses.
   * **`default`** (no modifier): Accessible within the same package.
   * **`private`**: Accessible only within the same class.

### PACKAGE CONTENTS

A package can contain:
   * **Classes and Interfaces**: Java source code files.
   * **Subpackages**: Nested packages within a package.
   * **Annotations**: Custom annotations defined within the package.
   * **Resources**: Non-Java files such as properties files.

### PACKAGE ANNOTATIONS

Packages can be annotated using annotations like `@Deprecated`, `@SuppressWarnings`, or custom annotations:

```java
@Deprecated
package com.example.myapp;
```

### PACKAGE OBJECTS AND SPECIFICATIONS

Java 14 introduced package-info.java files to specify package-level annotations and documentation:

```java
/**
 * This package contains classes related to application logic.
 */
package com.example.myapp;
```

### PACKAGE VISIBILITY

Packages in Java provide:
   * **Encapsulation**: Controlling access to classes and members.
   * **Namespace Management**: Preventing naming conflicts between classes from different packages.
   * **Access Control**: Defining which classes and members are accessible outside the package.

This manual provides a comprehensive overview of packages in Java, covering package naming conventions, type imports, package access control, package contents including classes, subpackages, annotations, and resources, package-level annotations, and specifications using package-info.java files. For more detailed information, refer to the Java documentation and additional resources.
