# CLASSES AND OBJECTS

Java is an object-oriented programming language where everything revolves around classes and objects. Classes define the blueprint for objects, which are instances of classes.

### A SIMPLE CLASS

A class in Java is defined using the `class` keyword. Here's an example of a simple class:

```java
public class Car {
    // Fields, constructors, and methods will be defined here
}
```

### FIELDS

Fields in Java are variables declared within a class. They represent the state of an object. Example:

```java
public class Car {
    private String model;
    private int year;
}
```

### ACCESS CONTROL

Access control determines the visibility of classes, fields, constructors, and methods in Java. Access modifiers include `public`, `private`, `protected`, and default (no modifier).

### CREATING OBJECTS

Objects are instances of classes created using the `new` keyword. Example:

```java
Car myCar = new Car();
```

### CONSTRUCTION AND INITIALIZATION

Constructors initialize objects. They have the same name as the class and no return type. Example:

```java
public class Car {
    private String model;
    
    // Constructor
    public Car(String model) {
        this.model = model;
    }
}
```

### METHODS

Methods define the behavior of objects. They are functions defined within a class. Example:

```java
public class Car {
    // Fields
    private String model;
    
    // Constructor
    public Car(String model) {
        this.model = model;
    }
    
    // Method
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving the " + model);
    }
}
```

### THIS

`this` refers to the current object instance. It is used to differentiate between instance variables and parameters with the same name.

### OVERLOADING METHODS

Method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. Example:

```java
public class Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    
    public double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

### IMPORTING STATIC MEMBER NAMES

Static members (fields and methods) can be imported using the `import static` statement for easier access in code.

### THE MAIN METHOD

The `main` method is the entry point for Java applications. It has a specific signature:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Program logic starts here
}
```

### NATIVE METHODS

Native methods are declared using the `native` keyword and provide access to platform-dependent libraries and resources. They are implemented in languages like C or C++.

```java
public class NativeExample {
    public native void nativeMethod();
    
    static {
        System.loadLibrary("NativeLibrary");
    }
}
```
