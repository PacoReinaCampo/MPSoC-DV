# TOKENS, VALUES, AND VARIABLES

In Java, tokens are the smallest units of a program's syntax, including keywords, identifiers, literals, operators, and punctuation marks. Values are the data held by variables or literals, while variables provide a means to store and manipulate data.

### LEXICAL ELEMENTS

Lexical elements are basic components of Java code that define its syntax and structure:
   * **Keywords**: Reserved words with predefined meanings (e.g., `public`, `class`, `int`).
   * **Identifiers**: Names given to classes, methods, variables, etc., adhering to specific naming rules (e.g., `main`, `myVariable`).
   * **Literals**: Represent constant values in code (e.g., `42` for integer, `"Hello"` for string).
   * **Operators**: Symbols used to perform operations on variables and values (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
   * **Punctuation**: Symbols like `{`, `}`, `;`, `,` used for grouping, termination, and separation in code.

### TYPES AND LITERALS

Java supports various data types:
   * **Primitive Types**: `int`, `double`, `boolean`, etc., for basic data storage.
   * **Reference Types**: Classes, interfaces, arrays, enums, and interfaces.

Literals are specific values assigned to variables or passed as arguments, representing constants in the code (e.g., `5` as an integer literal, `"Hello"` as a string literal).

### VARIABLES

Variables in Java hold data that can be changed during program execution. They must be declared with a specific data type and can be assigned values.

```java
int age; // Variable declaration
age = 25; // Variable initialization
```

Variables can also be initialized at the time of declaration:

```java
double pi = 3.14;
```

### ARRAY VARIABLES

Array variables in Java store multiple values of the same data type. They are declared using brackets `[]` after the data type.

```java
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Array initialization
```

Arrays have a fixed size once created, but their elements can be accessed and modified using index notation (`numbers[0]` accesses the first element).

### THE MEANINGS OF NAMES

In Java, names (identifiers) are crucial for variables, classes, methods, etc. They should be meaningful and adhere to naming conventions:
   * Start with a letter, underscore `_`, or dollar sign `$`.
   * Subsequent characters can include letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
   * Case-sensitive (`myVariable` is different from `MyVariable`).

Naming conventions promote readability and maintainability of code, enhancing collaboration and understanding among developers.

This manual provides a comprehensive overview of tokens, values, and variables in Java, covering lexical elements, types, literals, variable declaration and initialization, array variables, and guidelines for naming conventions.
