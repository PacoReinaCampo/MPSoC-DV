# INTERFACES

Interfaces in Java define a contract for classes to implement. They enable multiple inheritance of type (through abstract methods) and promote loose coupling in object-oriented design.

### A SIMPLE INTERFACE EXAMPLE

An interface in Java is declared using the `interface` keyword. It contains method signatures without implementations.

```java
public interface Animal {
    void makeSound();
    void eat();
}
```

### INTERFACE DECLARATIONS

Interfaces can declare methods, constants, and default methods (Java 8+). All interface methods are `public` by default and do not have method bodies.

```java
public interface Animal {
    void makeSound();
    void eat();
    
    int LEGS = 4; // Constant (implicitly public, static, final)
}
```

### EXTENDING INTERFACES

Interfaces can extend other interfaces using the `extends` keyword. This allows for hierarchical organization of interfaces.

```java
public interface Pet extends Animal {
    void play();
}
```

### WORKING WITH INTERFACES

Classes implement interfaces using the `implements` keyword. They must provide implementations for all interface methods.

```java
public class Dog implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
    
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Dog eats");
    }
}
```

### MARKER INTERFACES

Marker interfaces in Java are interfaces without any methods. They serve as tags to indicate certain behaviors or characteristics.

```java
public interface Serializable {
    // Marker interface indicating objects can be serialized
}
```

### WHEN TO USE INTERFACES

Interfaces are used in Java:
   * To define contracts for classes to implement, promoting code reuse and flexibility.
   * To achieve multiple inheritance of type when classes need to implement behaviors from multiple sources.
   * To enable polymorphism and dependency inversion, allowing for loose coupling and easier testing.
