# Process Assurance Objectives

The primary objectives of process assurance are:

1. **Ensure Compliance**: Verify that all development and assurance processes comply with relevant standards, guidelines, and regulatory requirements.
2. **Ensure Consistency**: Ensure that processes are performed consistently and correctly across all phases of the hardware lifecycle.
3. **Identify and Mitigate Risks**: Identify potential process-related risks and implement measures to mitigate them.
4. **Improve Quality**: Enhance the overall quality of the hardware by ensuring robust and effective processes are in place.
5. **Provide Transparency**: Maintain clear and comprehensive documentation of all processes, activities, and results to provide transparency and facilitate audits and reviews.
6. **Support Certification**: Provide evidence that all processes have been followed correctly to support the certification of the hardware.
