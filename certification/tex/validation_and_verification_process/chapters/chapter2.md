# VERIFICATION PROCESS

**Objective**: To ensure that the hardware design and implementation meet all specified requirements and are free from defects.

Key Activities:

1. **Requirements Verification**: Confirm that the hardware requirements are correctly and completely implemented.

   - Trace hardware requirements to design and test cases.
   - Perform requirements reviews to ensure completeness and accuracy.

2. **Design Verification**: Verify that the detailed design meets the specified requirements and design constraints.

   - Conduct design reviews and inspections.
   - Perform analysis and simulations to verify design performance.

3. **Component Testing**: Test individual hardware components to ensure they meet their specifications and function correctly.

   - Develop and execute component test plans.
   - Perform tests such as functional testing, performance testing, and stress testing.

4. **Integration Testing**: Verify that integrated hardware components work together as intended.

   - Conduct integration tests to ensure correct interactions between components.
   - Validate communication interfaces and data flows.

5. **System Testing**: Perform comprehensive testing on the complete hardware system to ensure it meets all requirements.

   - Execute system-level test plans.
   - Perform tests such as functional testing, reliability testing, and safety testing.

6. **Verification Reporting**: Document the results of verification activities, including any issues found and corrective actions taken.

   - Compile verification test reports.
   - Document verification outcomes and ensure traceability to requirements.
