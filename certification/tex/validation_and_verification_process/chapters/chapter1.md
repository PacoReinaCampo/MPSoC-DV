# Validation Process

*The validation process discussed here is intended to ensure that the derived requirements are correct and complete with respect to the system requirements allocated to the hardware item through the use of a combination of objective and subjective processes. Validation may be conducted before or after the hardware item is available, however, validation is typically conducted throughout the design life cycle.*
