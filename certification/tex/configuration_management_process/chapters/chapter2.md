# Configuration Management Activities

Configuration management involves several key activities to achieve its objectives:

1. Configuration Identification

**Objective**: Identify and document the configuration items (CIs) that need to be controlled throughout the hardware lifecycle.

**Key Activities**:

   - Define and list all CIs, including hardware components, design documents, specifications, test procedures, and tools.
   - Assign unique identifiers to each CI.
   - Establish baselines for each stage of the development process, capturing the state of CIs at specific points in time.

2. Configuration Control

**Objective**: Manage changes to the CIs to ensure that modifications are made systematically and approved appropriately.

**Key Activities**:

   - Implement a change control process to evaluate, approve, and document changes.
   - Establish a Configuration Control Board (CCB) to review and approve proposed changes.
   - Document change requests, impact assessments, approvals, and implementation actions.
   - Track and manage changes to ensure they are accurately reflected in the design data and documentation.

3. Configuration Status Accounting

**Objective**: Record and report the status of CIs and changes throughout the hardware lifecycle.

**Key Activities**:

   - Maintain records of the status of each CI, including its current configuration and any changes made.
   - Provide regular reports on the status of configurations, changes, and baselines.
   - Ensure that configuration records are updated and accurate.

4. Configuration Audits

**Objective**: Verify that the CIs conform to their documented requirements and that configuration management processes are being followed.

**Key Activities**:

   - Conduct configuration audits to ensure compliance with configuration management policies and procedures.
   - Perform functional and physical configuration audits to verify that the hardware and documentation match the approved configurations.
   - Document audit findings and ensure that any discrepancies are resolved.

5. Configuration Documentation

**Objective**: Ensure that all configuration management activities and CI information are thoroughly documented.

**Key Activities**:

   - Create and maintain a Configuration Management Plan (CMP) that outlines CM processes, roles, responsibilities, and tools.
   - Document configuration identification, control processes, status accounting, and audit results.
   - Maintain accurate and up-to-date configuration records and documentation.
