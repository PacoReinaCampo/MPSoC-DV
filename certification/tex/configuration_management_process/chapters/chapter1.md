# CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES

The main objectives of the configuration management process are:

1. **Ensure Consistency and Accuracy**: Maintain the integrity and accuracy of the hardware design data throughout its lifecycle.
2. **Control Changes**: Manage and document all changes to the hardware design to ensure that they are implemented systematically and do not introduce unintended issues.
3. **Maintain Traceability**: Ensure that all hardware components, documents, and configurations can be traced back to their original requirements and subsequent changes.
4. **Support Certification**: Provide the necessary documentation and evidence to support certification and regulatory compliance.
5. **Facilitate Communication**: Improve communication among team members and stakeholders by providing a clear and organized record of design data and changes.
6. **Preserve History**: Maintain a historical record of changes and configurations to support future reference, maintenance, and troubleshooting.
