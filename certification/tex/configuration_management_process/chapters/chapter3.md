# Data Control Categories

Data control categories are classifications of data that help manage and control the various types of information involved in hardware design and development. These categories help ensure that each type of data is handled appropriately according to its importance and sensitivity.

## Key Data Control Categories:

1. **Design Data**: 
   - **Description**: Includes all information related to the design of the hardware, such as schematics, diagrams, models, and specifications.
   - **Control Measures**: Version control, access restrictions, and change tracking.

2. **Requirements Data**:
   - **Description**: Comprises the hardware requirements derived from system-level requirements and safety assessments.
   - **Control Measures**: Traceability to system requirements, change control, and approval processes.

3. **Verification and Validation Data**:
   - **Description**: Includes test plans, procedures, results, and analysis reports used to verify and validate the hardware design.
   - **Control Measures**: Documentation of test outcomes, traceability to requirements, and review/approval workflows.

4. **Configuration Management Records**:
   - **Description**: Consists of records of configuration items, change requests, approval records, and status accounting logs.
   - **Control Measures**: Maintenance of accurate records, regular updates, and audit trails.

5. **Manufacturing Data**:
   - **Description**: Encompasses data related to the production of hardware, such as manufacturing instructions, assembly procedures, and quality control measures.
   - **Control Measures**: Controlled release of manufacturing documents, version control, and process audits.

6. **Maintenance and Support Data**:
   - **Description**: Includes information necessary for the ongoing maintenance and support of the hardware, such as maintenance schedules, repair procedures, and support documentation.
   - **Control Measures**: Regular updates, access control, and documentation of maintenance actions.

By implementing these configuration management activities and properly categorizing data, organizations can maintain control over their hardware design processes, ensure compliance with standards and regulations, and support the successful certification and deployment of airborne electronic hardware.
