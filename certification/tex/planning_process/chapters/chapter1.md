# Planning Process Objectives

The objectives of the planning process are to:

1. **Define Clear Goals and Scope**: Establish the overall goals and scope of the hardware development project, ensuring alignment with system-level requirements and safety standards.
2. **Establish Structured Plans**: Develop detailed plans that outline the activities, methodologies, resources, and schedules for the entire hardware development lifecycle.
3. **Ensure Resource Allocation**: Identify and allocate the necessary resources, including personnel, tools, and facilities, to support the development and assurance processes.
4. **Facilitate Communication and Coordination**: Ensure effective communication and coordination among all stakeholders, including design, verification, validation, and certification teams.
5. **Mitigate Risks**: Identify potential risks and develop mitigation strategies to address them throughout the hardware development lifecycle.
6. **Ensure Compliance**: Ensure that all planning activities comply with relevant standards, regulations, and certification requirements.
7. **Set Performance Metrics**: Define performance metrics and criteria for success to monitor progress and ensure that project objectives are met.
