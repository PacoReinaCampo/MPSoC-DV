# Detailed Design Process

**Objective**: To translate the conceptual design into detailed specifications and schematics.

Key Activities:

1. **Developing Schematics**: Create detailed schematics, layout diagrams, and wiring diagrams based on the conceptual design.
2. **Detailed Analysis**: Perform detailed analyses, such as worst-case analysis, thermal analysis, and signal integrity analysis, to ensure the design meets all requirements.
3. **Prototyping**: Develop prototypes to validate design concepts and identify potential issues.
4. **Design Documentation**: Document all aspects of the detailed design, including specifications, design decisions, and analysis results.
5. **Design Reviews**: Conduct formal design reviews to verify the detailed design against requirements and obtain stakeholder approvals.
