# Conceptual Design Process

*The conceptual design process produces a high-level design concept that may be assessed to determine the potential for the resulting design implementation to meet the requirements. This may be accomplished using such items as functional block diagrams, design and architecture descriptions, circuit card assembly outlines, and chassis sketches.*
