# Conceptual Design Process

**Objective**: To develop high-level design concepts that meet the specified hardware requirements.

Key Activities:

1. **Creating Architectural Models**: Develop block diagrams and architectural models to represent the high-level design of the hardware.
2. **Component Selection**: Identify and select key components and technologies that will be used in the design.
3. **Preliminary Safety Assessment**: Conduct initial safety and risk assessments on the conceptual design to identify potential hazards and mitigation strategies.
4. **Feasibility Studies**: Perform feasibility studies to ensure the conceptual design is viable within the project constraints.
5. **Documentation**: Document the conceptual design, including design rationale, component choices, and preliminary safety assessments.
6. **Review and Approval**: Review the conceptual design with stakeholders and obtain approvals to proceed to detailed design.
