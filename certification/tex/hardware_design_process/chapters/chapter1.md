# Requirements Capture Process

**Objective**: To define and document the hardware requirements based on system-level requirements and safety assessments.

## Key Activities:

1. **Gathering Requirements**: Collect requirements from various sources, including system specifications, safety assessments, and stakeholder inputs.
2. **Analyzing Requirements**: Ensure that the requirements are clear, complete, and feasible. This involves assessing their technical and safety implications.
3. **Documenting Requirements**: Create a comprehensive requirements specification document that captures all functional, performance, and safety requirements.
4. **Traceability**: Establish traceability between system-level requirements and hardware requirements to ensure all system needs are addressed.
5. **Review and Approval**: Conduct reviews to verify the completeness and accuracy of the requirements document and obtain necessary approvals from stakeholders.
