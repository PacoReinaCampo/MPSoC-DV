# Requirements Capture Process

*The requirements capture process identifies and records the hardware item requirements. This includes those derived requirements imposed by the proposed hardware item architecture, choice of technology, the basic and optional functionality, environmental, and performance requirements as well as the requirements imposed by the system safety assessment. This process may be iterative since additional requirements may become known during design.*
