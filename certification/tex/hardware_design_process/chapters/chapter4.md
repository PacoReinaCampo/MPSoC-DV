# Implementation Process

**Objective**: To realize the detailed design in physical hardware.

Key Activities:

1. **Manufacturing Prototypes**: Produce initial prototypes or small-scale production units based on the detailed design.
2. **Assembly and Integration**: Assemble and integrate the hardware components to create functional units.
3. **Initial Testing**: Conduct initial functional tests to verify the basic operation of the hardware.
4. **Issue Resolution**: Identify and resolve any issues discovered during initial testing and assembly.
5. **Documentation**: Document the implementation process, including assembly instructions, test results, and any changes made during implementation.
