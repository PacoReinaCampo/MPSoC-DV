# Series Production

**Objective**: To produce hardware units in large quantities for operational use.

Key Activities:

1. **Scaling Production**: Scale up production processes to produce hardware units in the required quantities.
2. **Quality Control**: Implement rigorous quality control measures to ensure consistency and reliability in mass production.
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Continuously monitor production processes to identify and address any issues promptly.
4. **Maintenance of Production Documentation**: Keep production documentation up to date, including process adjustments and quality control records.
5. **Customer Delivery**: Deliver hardware units to customers, ensuring they meet all specifications and quality standards.
6. **Post-Production Support**: Provide ongoing support and maintenance for the hardware, addressing any issues that arise in service.

By following these processes, organizations can ensure a structured and rigorous approach to hardware design, leading to the development of safe, reliable, and certifiable airborne electronic hardware.
