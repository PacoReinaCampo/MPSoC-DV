# Use of Previously Developed Hardware

**Description**: The use of previously developed hardware refers to the practice of incorporating existing hardware designs, components, or modules into new hardware projects.

**Importance**: Leveraging previously developed hardware can reduce development time, cost, and risk, especially for components or systems that have been proven to meet similar requirements in previous projects.

**Considerations**:

- **Legacy Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility with existing systems, interfaces, and standards when integrating previously developed hardware.
- **Documentation Review**: Conduct a thorough review of documentation, test results, and validation data from previous projects to verify the suitability and compliance of reused hardware.
- **Configuration Management**: Implement robust configuration management practices to track and manage changes to reused hardware components or designs.
