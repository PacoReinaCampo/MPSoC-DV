# Use of Previously Developed Hardware

*This section discusses the issues associated with the use of previously developed hardware. Guidance includes the assessment of modifications to the hardware, to the aircraft installation, to the application environment, or to the design environment and upgrading design baselines. Guidance for COTS component usage, a special case of previously developed hardware, is covered. Configuration Management and Process Assurance considerations should also be addressed for each use of previously developed hardware.*
