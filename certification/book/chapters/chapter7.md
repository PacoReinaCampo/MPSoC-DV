# CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT PROCESS

Configuration management (CM) in the context of DO-254 involves a systematic process to ensure the consistency, accuracy, and control of all hardware design data throughout the development lifecycle. This process is critical for maintaining traceability, managing changes, and supporting certification efforts.

## Configuration Management Objectives

The main objectives of the configuration management process are:

1. **Ensure Consistency and Accuracy**: Maintain the integrity and accuracy of the hardware design data throughout its lifecycle.
2. **Control Changes**: Manage and document all changes to the hardware design to ensure that they are implemented systematically and do not introduce unintended issues.
3. **Maintain Traceability**: Ensure that all hardware components, documents, and configurations can be traced back to their original requirements and subsequent changes.
4. **Support Certification**: Provide the necessary documentation and evidence to support certification and regulatory compliance.
5. **Facilitate Communication**: Improve communication among team members and stakeholders by providing a clear and organized record of design data and changes.
6. **Preserve History**: Maintain a historical record of changes and configurations to support future reference, maintenance, and troubleshooting.

## Configuration Management Activities

Configuration management involves several key activities to achieve its objectives:

1. Configuration Identification

**Objective**: Identify and document the configuration items (CIs) that need to be controlled throughout the hardware lifecycle.

**Key Activities**:
- Define and list all CIs, including hardware components, design documents, specifications, test procedures, and tools.
- Assign unique identifiers to each CI.
- Establish baselines for each stage of the development process, capturing the state of CIs at specific points in time.

2. Configuration Control

**Objective**: Manage changes to the CIs to ensure that modifications are made systematically and approved appropriately.

**Key Activities**:
- Implement a change control process to evaluate, approve, and document changes.
- Establish a Configuration Control Board (CCB) to review and approve proposed changes.
- Document change requests, impact assessments, approvals, and implementation actions.
- Track and manage changes to ensure they are accurately reflected in the design data and documentation.

3. Configuration Status Accounting

**Objective**: Record and report the status of CIs and changes throughout the hardware lifecycle.

**Key Activities**:
- Maintain records of the status of each CI, including its current configuration and any changes made.
- Provide regular reports on the status of configurations, changes, and baselines.
- Ensure that configuration records are updated and accurate.

4. Configuration Audits

**Objective**: Verify that the CIs conform to their documented requirements and that configuration management processes are being followed.

**Key Activities**:
- Conduct configuration audits to ensure compliance with configuration management policies and procedures.
- Perform functional and physical configuration audits to verify that the hardware and documentation match the approved configurations.
- Document audit findings and ensure that any discrepancies are resolved.

5. Configuration Documentation

**Objective**: Ensure that all configuration management activities and CI information are thoroughly documented.

**Key Activities**:
- Create and maintain a Configuration Management Plan (CMP) that outlines CM processes, roles, responsibilities, and tools.
- Document configuration identification, control processes, status accounting, and audit results.
- Maintain accurate and up-to-date configuration records and documentation.

## Data Control Categories

Data control categories are classifications of data that help manage and control the various types of information involved in hardware design and development. These categories help ensure that each type of data is handled appropriately according to its importance and sensitivity.

### Key Data Control Categories:

1. **Design Data**: 
   - **Description**: Includes all information related to the design of the hardware, such as schematics, diagrams, models, and specifications.
   - **Control Measures**: Version control, access restrictions, and change tracking.

2. **Requirements Data**:
   - **Description**: Comprises the hardware requirements derived from system-level requirements and safety assessments.
   - **Control Measures**: Traceability to system requirements, change control, and approval processes.

3. **Verification and Validation Data**:
   - **Description**: Includes test plans, procedures, results, and analysis reports used to verify and validate the hardware design.
   - **Control Measures**: Documentation of test outcomes, traceability to requirements, and review/approval workflows.

4. **Configuration Management Records**:
   - **Description**: Consists of records of configuration items, change requests, approval records, and status accounting logs.
   - **Control Measures**: Maintenance of accurate records, regular updates, and audit trails.

5. **Manufacturing Data**:
   - **Description**: Encompasses data related to the production of hardware, such as manufacturing instructions, assembly procedures, and quality control measures.
   - **Control Measures**: Controlled release of manufacturing documents, version control, and process audits.

6. **Maintenance and Support Data**:
   - **Description**: Includes information necessary for the ongoing maintenance and support of the hardware, such as maintenance schedules, repair procedures, and support documentation.
   - **Control Measures**: Regular updates, access control, and documentation of maintenance actions.

By implementing these configuration management activities and properly categorizing data, organizations can maintain control over their hardware design processes, ensure compliance with standards and regulations, and support the successful certification and deployment of airborne electronic hardware.
