# HARDWARE DESIGN LIFECYCLE DATA

*This section describes the hardware design life cycle data items that may be produced during the hardware design life cycle for providing evidence of design assurance and compliance with certification requirements. The scope, amount and detail of the life cycle data needed by the certification authorities as design assurance evidence will vary depending on a number of factors. These factors include the applicable certification authority requirements for the airborne system, the assigned design assurance levels, the complexity and the service experience of the hardware. Details of the design assurance evidence should be identified, recorded in the PHAC and agreed to with the certification authorities.*

## Hardware Plans

*The hardware plans describe the processes, procedures, methods, and standards to be used for the hardware certification, design, validation, verification, process assurance and configuration control.*

### Plan for Hardware Aspects of Certification

*The PHAC defines the processes, procedures, methods and standards to be used to achieve the objectives of this document and obtain certification authority approval for certification of the system containing hardware items. The PHAC, once approved, represents an agreement between the certification applicant and the certification authority on the processes and activities to be conducted and the resultant evidence to be produced to satisfy the hardware aspects of certification. The PHAC may be part of another plan, such as the airborne system certification plan.*

### Hardware Design Plan

*The hardware design plan describes the procedures, methods and standards to be applied and the processes and activities to be conducted for the design of the hardware item. This plan may be included in the PHAC and may reference design policies and standards to be applied.*

### Hardware Validation Plan

*The validation plan describes the procedures, methods and standards to be applied and the processes and activities to be conducted for the validation of the hardware item derived requirements to achieve the validation objectives of this document. This plan may be included in the PHAC and may reference validation standards to be applied.*

### Hardware Verification Plan

*The verification plan describes the procedures, methods and standards to be applied and the processes and activities to be conducted for the verification of the hardware items to achieve the verification objectives of this document. This plan may be included in the PHAC and may reference verification policies and standards to be applied.*

### Hardware Configuration Management Plan

*The hardware configuration management plan describes the policies, procedures, standards and methods to be used to satisfy the configuration management objectives of this document.*

### Hardware Process Assurance Plan

*The hardware process assurance plan describes the procedures, methods and standards to be applied and the processes and activities to be conducted for achieving the process assurance objectives of this document.*
