# HARDWARE DESIGN LIFECYCLE DATA

*This section describes the hardware design life cycle data items that may be produced during the hardware design life cycle for providing evidence of design assurance and compliance with certification requirements. The scope, amount and detail of the life cycle data needed by the certification authorities as design assurance evidence will vary depending on a number of factors. These factors include the applicable certification authority requirements for the airborne system, the assigned design assurance levels, the complexity and the service experience of the hardware. Details of the design assurance evidence should be identified, recorded in the PHAC and agreed to with the certification authorities.*

## Hardware Plans

*The hardware plans describe the processes, procedures, methods, and standards to be used for the hardware certification, design, validation, verification, process assurance and configuration control.*
