# CERTIFICATION LIAISON PROCESS

*The purpose of the certification liaison process is to establish communication and understanding between the applicant and the certification authority throughout the hardware design life cycle to assist in the certification process. In addition, liaison activities may include design approach presentation for timely approval, negotiations concerning the means of compliance with the certification basis, approval of design approach, means of data approval, and any required certification authority reviews and witnessing of tests.*

## Means of Compliance and Planning

*The applicant proposes a means of compliance for hardware. The PHAC defines the proposed means of compliance.*

## Compliance Substantiation

*The applicant provides evidence that the hardware design life cycle processes have satisfied the hardware plans. Certification authority reviews may take place at the applicant’s facilities or applicant’s supplier’s facilities. The applicant arranges these reviews and makes hardware design life cycle data available as needed.*
