## REQUIREMENTS CAPTURE PROCESS

**Objective**: To define and document the hardware requirements based on system-level requirements and safety assessments.

Key Activities:

1. **Gathering Requirements**: Collect requirements from various sources, including system specifications, safety assessments, and stakeholder inputs.
2. **Analyzing Requirements**: Ensure that the requirements are clear, complete, and feasible. This involves assessing their technical and safety implications.
3. **Documenting Requirements**: Create a comprehensive requirements specification document that captures all functional, performance, and safety requirements.
4. **Traceability**: Establish traceability between system-level requirements and hardware requirements to ensure all system needs are addressed.
5. **Review and Approval**: Conduct reviews to verify the completeness and accuracy of the requirements document and obtain necessary approvals from stakeholders.

## CONCEPTUAL DESIGN PROCESS

**Objective**: To develop high-level design concepts that meet the specified hardware requirements.

Key Activities:

1. **Creating Architectural Models**: Develop block diagrams and architectural models to represent the high-level design of the hardware.
2. **Component Selection**: Identify and select key components and technologies that will be used in the design.
3. **Preliminary Safety Assessment**: Conduct initial safety and risk assessments on the conceptual design to identify potential hazards and mitigation strategies.
4. **Feasibility Studies**: Perform feasibility studies to ensure the conceptual design is viable within the project constraints.
5. **Documentation**: Document the conceptual design, including design rationale, component choices, and preliminary safety assessments.
6. **Review and Approval**: Review the conceptual design with stakeholders and obtain approvals to proceed to detailed design.

## DETAILED DESIGN PROCESS

**Objective**: To translate the conceptual design into detailed specifications and schematics.

Key Activities:

1. **Developing Schematics**: Create detailed schematics, layout diagrams, and wiring diagrams based on the conceptual design.
2. **Detailed Analysis**: Perform detailed analyses, such as worst-case analysis, thermal analysis, and signal integrity analysis, to ensure the design meets all requirements.
3. **Prototyping**: Develop prototypes to validate design concepts and identify potential issues.
4. **Design Documentation**: Document all aspects of the detailed design, including specifications, design decisions, and analysis results.
5. **Design Reviews**: Conduct formal design reviews to verify the detailed design against requirements and obtain stakeholder approvals.

## IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS

**Objective**: To realize the detailed design in physical hardware.

Key Activities:

1. **Manufacturing Prototypes**: Produce initial prototypes or small-scale production units based on the detailed design.
2. **Assembly and Integration**: Assemble and integrate the hardware components to create functional units.
3. **Initial Testing**: Conduct initial functional tests to verify the basic operation of the hardware.
4. **Issue Resolution**: Identify and resolve any issues discovered during initial testing and assembly.
5. **Documentation**: Document the implementation process, including assembly instructions, test results, and any changes made during implementation.

## PRODUCTION TRANSITION

**Objective**: To transition the hardware from development to full-scale production.
