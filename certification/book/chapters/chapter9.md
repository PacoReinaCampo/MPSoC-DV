# CERTIFICATION LIAISON PROCESS

The certification liaison process is essential for ensuring that airborne electronic hardware meets all regulatory requirements and standards necessary for certification. This process involves establishing and maintaining communication with certification authorities to demonstrate compliance and to facilitate the certification process.

## MEANS OF COMPLIANCE AND PLANNING

**Objective**: Define and plan the methods by which compliance with regulatory requirements will be demonstrated throughout the hardware development lifecycle.

Key Activities: Means of Compliance and Planning

1. **Identify Regulatory Requirements**:

   * **Objective**: Determine the specific regulatory requirements and standards applicable to the hardware.
   * **Activity**: Review relevant regulations, such as those from the FAA, EASA, or other certification authorities, and identify applicable DO-254 objectives.

2. **Develop Compliance Plans**:

   * **Objective**: Create detailed plans outlining how compliance will be achieved and demonstrated.
   * **Activity**: Develop a Plan for Hardware Aspects of Certification (PHAC) that specifies compliance strategies, activities, roles, and responsibilities.

3. **Define Means of Compliance**:

   * **Objective**: Identify the specific methods and processes that will be used to demonstrate compliance with each requirement.
   * **Activity**: Determine the verification and validation activities, analyses, tests, inspections, and reviews that will be performed.

4. **Engage with Certification Authorities**:

   * **Objective**: Establish early and ongoing communication with certification authorities to align on compliance approaches.
   * **Activity**: Hold initial meetings and regular updates with certification authorities to discuss compliance plans and receive feedback.

5. **Document Compliance Strategies**:

   * **Objective**: Ensure that all compliance strategies and plans are thoroughly documented and approved.
   * **Activity**: Create and maintain documentation that outlines compliance methods, schedules, and resource allocations.

## COMPLIANCE SUBSTANTIATION

**Objective**: Provide evidence and documentation to demonstrate that the hardware design and development processes meet all regulatory requirements and standards.

Key Activities: Compliance Substantiation

1. **Collect Compliance Evidence**:

   * **Objective**: Gather all necessary evidence that demonstrates compliance with regulatory requirements.
   * **Activity**: Collect test results, analysis reports, review records, and audit findings.

2. **Prepare Compliance Documentation**:

   * **Objective**: Compile and organize all documentation needed to substantiate compliance.
   * **Activity**: Prepare comprehensive compliance documents such as the Hardware Accomplishment Summary (HAS), which summarizes compliance activities and evidence.

3. **Perform Compliance Reviews**:

   * **Objective**: Conduct internal reviews to ensure that all compliance evidence and documentation are complete and accurate.
   * **Activity**: Perform detailed reviews of all compliance materials to verify their adequacy and correctness.

4. **Submit Compliance Data to Authorities**:

   * **Objective**: Provide certification authorities with the necessary documentation and evidence to support the certification process.
   * **Activity**: Submit the PHAC, HAS, and other required documents to certification authorities for review and approval.

5. **Respond to Certification Authority Feedback**:

   * **Objective**: Address any questions, comments, or concerns raised by certification authorities during their review.
   * **Activity**: Provide additional information, clarification, or corrective actions as needed to resolve any issues.

6. **Maintain Compliance Records**:

   * **Objective**: Ensure that all compliance-related records are maintained and accessible for future reference and audits.
   * **Activity**: Organize and archive all compliance documentation, including evidence of compliance and communication with certification authorities.

7. **Support Certification Audits**:

   * **Objective**: Assist certification authorities during their audits and reviews of the hardware development processes and compliance evidence.
   * **Activity**: Prepare for and participate in certification audits, providing access to records and responding to auditor inquiries.

By effectively managing the certification liaison process, organizations can ensure that their hardware development projects meet all regulatory requirements, facilitating a smooth and successful certification process. This involves careful planning, thorough documentation, and proactive engagement with certification authorities to demonstrate compliance and achieve certification approval.
