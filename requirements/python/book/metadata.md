abstract: Welcome to The Python Programming Language, an introductory book about Python. The Python programming language helps you write faster, more reliable software. High-level ergonomics and low-level control are often at odds in programming language design; Python challenges that conflict. Through balancing powerful technical capacity and a great developer experience, Python gives you the option to control low-level details (such as memory usage) without all the hassle traditionally associated with such control.
