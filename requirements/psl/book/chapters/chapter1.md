# OVERVIEW

The PSL (Property Specification Language) is a formal language used to specify properties of hardware designs, particularly for functional verification in electronic design automation (EDA). Here's a detailed explanation based on the PSL framework:

PSL is primarily used to describe and verify the behavior of digital circuits. It helps designers ensure that their hardware designs meet specified properties and behave as expected under all possible scenarios.

## SCOPE

The scope of PSL covers the entire lifecycle of hardware design verification, from the initial specification of design properties to the final verification of these properties against the implemented design. PSL can be applied to various hardware description languages (HDLs) such as VHDL, Verilog, SystemVerilog, and more.

## PURPOSE

PSL's purpose is to provide a standardized way to describe properties and assertions about hardware designs. It facilitates the verification process by enabling the automatic checking of these properties, thus ensuring the correctness and reliability of the design.

### Background

PSL was developed to address the need for a more expressive and standardized language for property specification in hardware verification. Before PSL, various proprietary and less expressive languages were used, leading to inefficiencies and inconsistencies in the verification process.

### Motivation

The motivation behind PSL is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of hardware design verification. By providing a powerful and standardized language for specifying properties, PSL helps designers catch design errors early in the development process, reducing the time and cost associated with hardware development.

### Goals

The goals of PSL are to:

- Provide a clear and expressive syntax for specifying properties.
- Enable automatic and formal verification of hardware designs.
- Support a wide range of HDLs and verification tools.
- Improve the accuracy and reliability of hardware design verification.

## USAGE

PSL is used throughout the hardware design verification process, from writing specifications to verifying the final design. It allows designers to write assertions and properties that describe the expected behavior of the design, which can then be checked using formal verification tools.

### Functional specification

The functional specification in PSL involves writing properties that describe the expected behavior of the hardware design. These properties are expressed using PSL's syntax and constructs, such as sequences, assertions, and temporal operators. For example, a designer might specify that a certain signal should always be high whenever another signal is low.

### Functional verification

Functional verification with PSL involves checking the specified properties against the actual hardware design. This can be done using various formal verification tools that support PSL. These tools automatically analyze the design and check whether the specified properties hold true in all possible scenarios. If any property fails, the tool provides counterexamples to help the designer identify and fix the issue.

In summary, PSL plays a crucial role in ensuring the correctness and reliability of hardware designs by providing a standardized and expressive language for property specification and verification. Its usage spans the entire design verification process, helping designers catch errors early and reduce development costs.
